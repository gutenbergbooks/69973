<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The object of this
book is to prove, from a series of scenes drawn from real life, the misery of
those, whether rich or poor, who live without Christ, and the peace and comfort
of those in whom the spirit of Christ dwells as actuating principles of duty.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The scenes were
selected by the author from a number, either falling under her own observation,
or narrated by friends who vouched for their truthfulness. They are not the most
wonderful thus brought to her notice, but were chosen because they more plainly
prove the object referred to.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The devotion of time
and money, by a young lady described here under the name of Marion Howard, is
not fiction. The eccentricities of Mr. Regy, the sorrows of poor Esther, are
facts. The singular circumstances connected with the brother and sister from a
foreign land, inmates at the same time of the Home for the Sick, though unknown
to each other, were given to the public at the time, and excited great interest
for the unfortunate strangers. Indeed, were we privileged to read the record
of cases in our hospitals, or the diary of our missionaries among the poor and
distressed, we should find that in our very midst scenes so wonderful are occurring
that fiction is left far in the background.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>My little book is sent
forth on the same mission as one of its predecessors, &quot;Tim the
Scissors-Grinder.&quot; That it may meet with the same success in winning souls
for the Master is the earnest prayer of</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;WELL!
well!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Asbury, after a preliminary &quot;Hem!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I know what you
would say, pa,&quot; interrupted Mrs. Asbury, in a deprecating tone. &quot;But
it isn't fair to judge so soon. It's a trying situation for a young clergyman.
If it was our Gardner, now, we should want people to remember that it isn't
easy to stand up before strangers and preach one's first sermon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I shan't be a
minister, ma; I've made up my mind on that.&quot; Joe looked at his sister, who
generally was not backward in expressing an opinion. Now she only said, as
though speaking to herself, &quot;I wonder what Marion would say.&quot; </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The family had just
returned from morning service, where the new pastor for the first time had met
the people. Aunt Thankful, as she was called, had taken off her bonnet and
shawl, folding the latter carefully in the creases; now, with a peremptory wave
of her hand to enjoin silence, she said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;There's either
sorrer or there's sin behind him. I'm inclined to think it's sorrer. It's
Scripter, you know, to let charity have its perfect work.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The door-bell at this
moment ringing, Aunt Thankful, who was passing Sunday with her friends, seized her
bonnet and shawl and left the room. Annie started for the door, to answer the
summons, while Joe opened his library book and began to read.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The sound of a manly
but nervous step in the chamber above called forth a sigh from Mr. Asbury,
followed by the words,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'm dreadfully
afraid, wife, we've made a mistake.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Don't look so
melancholy, pa,&quot; urged Annie, returning, &quot;or Mr. Angus will think we
are talking of him. He asked what time we dined, and said he would like to go
to his chamber for a few minutes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>While he paces back
and forth in the apartment assigned him, I will explain that the parish to
which Mr. Asbury belonged had lost their pastor by death six months before the
opening of our story; that a succession of candidates had been heard, discussed,
and dismissed; that the people, wearied out by their own criticisms, were
beginning to scatter; that at length they conceived the idea of sending a Committee
on an exploring tour, which Committee, going to hear a city preacher, heard in
his place a young man lately graduated from the divinity school; that they were
so impressed with his heartiness in his work they requested an introduction and
invited him to add one more to the number of competing candidates; that he
politely but firmly declined, not believing, this the proper method of
obtaining a clergyman that, after making inquiries of his Professors and
others, and receiving instructions to go forward from the church at home, the Committee
did proceed to call the Rev. Mr. Angus to be their pastor; that, after several
weeks of earnest prayer for guidance, he did accept their call, the public
services of his ordination to take place the week following his first sermon.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>His arrival in the
town, which I shall call Grantbury, late on Saturday evening, had given the
family little opportunity for forming an opinion of the new pastor; that he was
tall and vigorous in frame, with a countenance sad rather than smiling, eyes
looking far away, a sweet, musical voice with a sad note running through it,
was all that they knew of him until they took their seats in church directly in
front of the pulpit. The sermon was on Christ's invitation to the weary and
heavy laden to come to him for rest. In the most graphic language he depicted
the condition of these poor, sad, weary sufferers, bearing their heavy burden
of sin and sorrow, longing to be rid of it, but knowing not how to throw it
off, groaning in secret places, with an abiding dread of what the future might
bring to them. He brought tears to many eyes unused to weep, by the vividness
with which he portrayed the soul in darkness, but longing for the light, empty,
void of faith in God or man, shut up in a prison of gloomy thought and
forebodings, every day verging toward the frightful chasm of despair.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Listening to the
preacher's voice trembling with pathos, no one could doubt that he well
understood by personal experience the condition of those to whom our blessed
Lord extended this gracious invitation. Every eye was fixed on his, every heart
followed him; but when, turning from the weary and heavy laden, he pointed to
the One who could deliver them from all their wretchedness, the note of sadness
still lingered. Instead of the triumphant ring of victory from the freed soul,
the tone of peace and rest from those delivered from their heavy load, there
was an unexplained want of harmony between the manner and voice of the speaker
and the subject of which he was treating. A general restlessness among the
audience proved their disappointment.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The sermon closed with
a passionate appeal to all present to accept Christ's offer of pardon, peace,
and rest. The people rose to receive the benediction, half wondering at the
sadness which oppressed them. Under other circumstances they would have crowded
around the new pastor, offering their hands in token of their welcome. They
had been prepared to receive him with enthusiasm. The weeks of suspense during
which they were waiting his reply to their call had deepened their anxiety to
obtain the services of one so highly recommended, but a weight had fallen on
their spirits, and they silently left the church, a few casting glances back to
the pulpit, where sat a figure prone and abject, the face buried in the hands.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>So it happened that
only the Committee who had heard him in the city waited to speak to him, and at
length accompanied him, almost in silence, to the house of Mr. Asbury, where he
was to remain until after his ordination.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>IN the mean time, in
the spacious chamber assigned to the clergyman, a terrible conflict was raging.
Possessed of the keenest susceptibilities, with a morbid sense of his own
unworthiness, he was, alas, too well aware of the impression left upon his
hearers by his morning's discourse.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;God forgive
me!&quot; he ejaculated, his hands pressed to his head. &quot;Deliver me from
this terrible burden. Make known to me thy will. Thou knowest my heart. I
thought I heard thy voice. Show me the way in which I should walk. How can I,
laden with sorrow, stand in God's stead and preach the gospel of salvation?
Make haste to help me, O Lord! All my trust is in thee.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>A light tap at his
door disturbed his meditations. He presented to Annie a face so pallid and
suffering that she started back, exclaiming,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You are ill, Mr.
Angus: let me call mother.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh no! I am not
ill,—I mean not much. Certainly, I have a headache.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I came to say
that dinner is ready. Mother will give you something for your head.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Thank you. I
will be down-stairs directly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He turned to his
washstand and dashed cold water on his burning forehead, then, crushing back
the wretched doubts and fears which had oppressed him, he presented himself in
the parlor.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>His pallid countenance
confirmed Annie's statement of his illness. Mrs. Asbury, with true motherly
kindness, ordered a cup of coffee with out milk or sugar, but postponed an
examination of the case until a more fitting opportunity.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Seated opposite Mr.
Angus at the table was fairy little figure, introduced to him as &quot;Our baby
Ethel.&quot; She had large gray eyes shaded and deepened by long, black lashes.
Raising her eyes timidly at first, she glanced at the stranger, gave a little
start at the expression which beamed in his face, then her whole
countenance—eyes, cheeks, and lips—grew radiant and, to the utter astonishment of
all present, the shy, timid little one, whose caresses were so daintily given,
so highly prized, exclaimed,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I love
you!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Why,
Ethel!&quot; began her father. &quot;Why, Baby!&quot; repeated the mother; but
Annie, catching a glimpse of intense, yearning love in the face of the
clergyman, wondered in silence.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>After dinner, one look
of entreaty brought the little miss to the clergyman,—no longer a
stranger,—when, to the undisguised astonishment of her parents, she allowed
herself to be folded in his arms, her long flaxen curls floating over his
breast. Nestling close to his side, with her eyes uplifted to his, she
remained, quietly listening to the conversation which followed, rewarded
occasionally by a smile so sweet, so full of tender yearning, that not only the
child's but the mother's heart was wholly won.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Asbury had asked
some questions concerning Mr. Angus's mission work in the city, and then said
to his wife,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Marion will like
to hear about this: she loves such work.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;She is a real
missionary herself,&quot; urged Annie. </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I love
Marion,&quot; lisped the child. &quot;She is my Marion.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Is she your
daughter, Mr. Asbury?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Not
exactly,&quot; laughing, &quot;though she is as near as a daughter. She is the
daughter of Mrs. Asbury's cousin, now deceased. Indeed she has lost both her
parents, and we have adopted her. She calls us uncle and aunt.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I want Marion to
come home quick, pa.&quot; Then, turning again to look in the face above her,
Ethel said, &quot;I'll let my Marion love you too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;A great piece of
condescension on Ethel's part, Mr. Angus,&quot; added the mother, laughing
heartily. &quot;The little puss is extremely jealous in her affection for
Marion, and scarce allows her cousin out of her sight for a moment when she is
at home.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Does your niece
not live at home, then?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh, no, sir.
She teaches music in Madame La Vergnes's Institute in New York; but, as her
classes only occupy six hours a day, she has abundant time for her poor
people.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It is against my
wish,&quot; urged her uncle, &quot;that she should stay away from home for so
many months in a year.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;But not contrary
to your consent, pa,&quot; explained Annie. &quot;You told her you wouldn't
forbid it. So, Mr. Angus,&quot; she added, blushing at her own earnestness,
&quot;you musn't think our Marion naughty or obstinate. It was her duty she
said, and so she went.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Ethel, I fear
you will tire Mr. Angus, sitting in his lap so long.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He pressed her tightly
in his arms and waited to hear what she would say.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;He's skeezing
me, ma. I guess he isn't tired. Are you?&quot; putting her hand softly on his
cheek.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He took the small hand
in his, held it for a moment, asked, &quot;At what time does your Sunday school
commence?&quot; put her hand to his lips as he said, rising, &quot;We are
friends from this time, Ethel. Good by for an hour or two,&quot; and left the
room.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I like him ever
so much,&quot; exclaimed Annie. &quot;Aren't you glad now, pa, that he has come
to be our minister?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Perhaps Mr. Asbury
would have answered still more warmly could he have followed the pastor to his
chamber and listened to the cry which went up from a full heart.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Is this a ray of
light from thy throne, O my heavenly Father? May I not accept it as an answer
to prayer for help,—as a token of thy loving care? O God, I bless thee!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Making his way from
his chamber, he saw Ethel sitting on the lower stair waiting for him.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You may kiss me
if you want to,&quot; she said, putting up her rosy lips.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He caught her in his
arms, kissed her again, the mother coming forward just in time to hear him say,
&quot;God bless you, precious child!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>How warm his heart
felt with this new glow. With his whole soul he received the loving confidence
of this little one as a token of divine favor. God had accepted him and would
bless his work among these people.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Arriving at the
chapel, the superintendent of the school came forward to meet him, with the
request that, in the place of the usual exercises, he would address them. But
Mr. Angus requested to be allowed to watch the workings of the school
consenting, however, to talk to them at the end.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Is this your
usual number?&quot; he inquired, glancing over the room.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes sir, about
the average.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Are they
punctual in their attendance,—teachers and scholars?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;No, sir; that is
one great drawback to success.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Do these children
not go to church? I saw few children there.&quot; </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;No, sir; they
seldom go.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Declining a seat on
the platform, Mr. Angus drew an arm-chair near the Bible class and waited for
the superintendent to call the school to order. The gong sounded, but the noise
did not decrease. The second time, with the aid of the teachers, the loud
whispering abated, when, in a low voice, impossible to be heard at the farther end
of the room, the superintendent offered prayer. A hymn was given out, and all
looked around for the lady who usually played the melodeon. She was absent, and
at last, just as the singing was to be omitted, Annie Asbury came forward
blushing, and said, &quot;I will try to play.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Angus was
afflicted with a keen ear for discords. I can only say that during the singing
he was agonized. Before the closing exercises he had made up his mind that here
at least there was work for the pastor. The apathy was alarming. With few
exceptions, the teachers hurried through the lesson, accepting without reproof
the too evidently manufactured excuses in place of a well-learned lesson; then
shutting the book, he or she became totally oblivious of all that was passing,
some even leaving the class to talk with another teacher.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>That was a face
thoroughly in earnest which confronted the school when the superintendent
announced that &quot;Rev. Mr. Angus, our pastor, will address you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In a full, impressive
voice the clergyman began. </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Boys and
girls,—yes, and teachers too,—we are strangers to-day, but we shall not
continue so. I have a good memory for names and faces. I intend to know you
all, every one. I have come here to be one of you, to love you, and I hope to
be loved in return. My business is to lead every one in this room to the arms
of the blessed Saviour, and I ask you all to help me. As many as are willing, I
ask to come after school and give me your hand in token of your acceptance of
this contract. Until we meet again next Sunday, I ask you to consider seriously
a few questions. You can give your answers in writing if you please. I shall
like that best; or you may come to me,—not in classes, but individually, and answer
them.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;First. What do I
come to Sunday school for,—to please God, or to please my parents, or to please
myself?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Second. Does my
coming just as I have been used to coming please God,—does it please my
parents,—does it please me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Third. If I
neither please God, my parents, nor myself, in what way can I change my actions
to do so?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Now, with the
permission of your superintendent, I will ask you to rise and join me in one
verse.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Praise God, from
whom all blessings flow;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Praise Him, all
creatures here below;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Praise Him above, ye
heavenly host;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Praise Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Remember God is
here: let us not mock Him; now begin.&quot; His voice was a deep, rich
baritone, which resounded through the chapel, carrying the scholars and
teachers with him. At the close, he stood with his hand extended toward a
little girl near him. Boys and girls pressed forward, each one giving his own
name, until only the teachers remained. To these, as they gathered around him,
he said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Will it be too
much for me to ask that each one of you will ponder the questions I gave you?
The work of a Sunday-school teacher may be wearisome and unpleasant, or it may
be glorious, most blessed. It is God's own work; and He is a good
paymaster.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Annie persuaded her
brother to wait for Mr. Angus, but hesitated about joining him when she saw how
sad he looked. With a frankness which was her peculiar charm she said,
timidly,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;We waited to
walk home with you, but perhaps you would rather go alone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Thank you,
yes.&quot; Then, rousing himself, he added, &quot;You are very kind. I shall be
glad of your company.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It was true that in
the excitement of the past hour his own personal grief had been absorbed in the
sorrow he felt at finding the Sunday school in such a low condition. He began
to realize that this was the keynote by which he must judge of the spiritual
state of the church. Then doubts of his fitness for the work assailed him, and
he was appalled with the reflection that it was too late now to recede. It was
at this minute that Annie met him. He would have given much to be alone, to
fight his battle unobserved; but no, it was better that he should not dwell on
such painful, unavailing thoughts.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Annie glanced at him
occasionally, as with knitted brows he hurried forward, but did not speak until
he was about to turn the wrong way.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;This is our
street, Mr. Angus,&quot; she said.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Pardon me,
Annie, I am usually quick at finding my way, but—I am thinking about your
Sunday school. Were the children more inattentive to-day than usual?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;No, sir. Marion
goes wild about it. She thinks everything in it is horrid. I heard her talking
to the superintendent; she told him the mode of teaching, the want of order,
the singing, were all as bad as could be; but Marion is a singer, you
know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;How long has
this gentleman been superintendent?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Only a few
weeks. They tried one and another, but nobody would take it. Marion said Mr.
Molton only accepted because he was too good-natured to say 'I won't,' as the
others did.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>At the close of the
evening service the congregation were not a little astonished by the request to
remain in their seats for a few minutes after the benediction had been
pronounced, nor was the astonishment abated when the young pastor elect began
to address them. It was as well for them to know it now as any time. He never made
any unnecessary preliminary remarks; he made a fierce dash at any subject and
done with it.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Every eye was fixed on
him when he began.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Owing to my
peculiar views as to the dignity of the office of an ambassador of Christ, I
declined to come among you as a candidate for your favor. I knew nothing of the
state of your church and society. I had no experience to guide me, except that
derived from my mission work among the poorest of the poor,—among those so
eager for the bread of life that it was a glorious privilege to break it for
them. I find your church large in numbers; I—yes I must say it—I am appalled, I
am young. It is not yet too late for you to relieve me from the
responsibilities which may prove too much for me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>His head sank on his
breast as a murmur, &quot;No! no! We want you,&quot; ran through the audience.
His voice trembled with emotion as, after a brief pause, he spoke again.
&quot;God's will be done; there is a great work to do here. We must begin with
the Sunday school. The help of every father and mother and child is necessary.
Above all, we must earnestly besiege the throne of grace for divine help.
Brethren and sisters, pray for each other and pray for your pastor, for his guidance;
that he may be holy, humble, earnest, and hopeful in his work of winning souls
for the Master.&quot;</span></p>

<h1><a id="Part_1_Chapter_3"><span class='c8'>CHAPTER III.</span></a></h1>

<h1><span class='c6'>THE HOME FOR THE SICK.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>IN one of the main
avenues in a large city stands a spacious building enclosed in garden. The
edifice and its ornamental surroundings occupy an entire square. Lofty trees
and low shrubs, parterres of flowers, picturesque arbors with rustic seats,
gravelled walks winding in and out among the blossoms, prove to the passer-by
that this is truly what the name indicates,—a &quot;Home for the Sick.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>A Russian nobleman,
after a thorough examination of the building itself, its lofty ceilings and
thorough ventilation, its conveniences for heating and cooking, its laundry
department, its beautiful, sunny wards, with the well-trained nurses moving
quietly from cot to cot for the relief of the sufferers, was asked,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What do you
think of our hospital?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>With a burst of
enthusiasm he exclaimed, &quot;It isn't a hospital, it is a palace where the
king receives his guests and takes care of them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>At this moment a
carriage is drawn up before the principal entrance and a young woman is
assisted to alight. Presently two men approach with a chair, in which she is
seated, a young lady who has accompanied her walking by her side.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>This is not her first
visit to the hospital. For months together she lay prostrate, struggling for
life, going away at last, not strong, certainly, but with a prospect of perfect
recovery. Now she knew she had come home to die. Yes, it was home in the truest
and sweetest sense of the word, for here she had been born of the Spirit. Old
things had passed away and all things had become new. Here she had joined
herself to the people of God, confessing Jesus Christ to be her only hope for
pardon and peace. She no longer shuddered at the approach of the grim
messenger; she was ready to welcome him whenever her Saviour called her to his
immediate presence.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She was placed in her
old bed, endeared by so many precious memories, where she could see the setting
sun, and by his resplendent glories be reminded of the Sun of Righteousness in
whose effulgent beams her soul would bask for ever and ever.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Oh, no! there was no
terror in the thought of death; the language of her heart was, &quot;Come, Lord
Jesus, come quickly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>As she lay reposing on
her spotless couch, her cheek rivalling the whiteness of her pillow, she
clasped her hands, exclaiming,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;How good God is!
Think of my being allowed to come home, to have my own bed! You were so
thoughtful, dear friend, to ask for that favor. This room has been like heaven
to me. I am afraid I ought not to be so happy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She glanced wistfully
in her companion's face, who understood the appeal and answered, warmly,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;God has forgiven
the past, dear. We are told to 'forget the things that are behind, and press
forward.' You have given that burden to the Saviour; don't take it back again:
it shows distrust of His loving care for those you have committed to Him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;If I could only
know before I die that he is safe—I mean that he has accepted Christ,—I would
ask no more. Poverty, even want, I do not care for.  Poverty brought me here,
where I found my precious, waiting Saviour; but oh, if I could know that in his
wanderings God's spirit has led him into the truth, how I would praise His name
to all eternity!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>An expression of holy
rapture beamed from every feature. Her friend gazed with glistening eyes.
Softly laying her hand on the head of the dying girl, she repeated the words,
&quot;who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot; Rising,
she pressed her lips to the forehead of the sufferer, whispered, &quot;I shall
come again tomorrow,&quot; and left the room.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In the morning Stella
found herself so much refreshed by sleep that when the chaplain came into the
ward she requested the privilege of having private communion administered to
her.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>This gentleman, Rev.
Mr. Owen, was not a stranger to her. It was his faithful words which had cut so
deep into her heart that for weeks her soul writhed with self-inflicted
torture. It was a sermon he preached one Sunday when she was in the chapel
which brought her to the feet of Jesus, clothed and in her right mind. The text
was this, &quot;If ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will
also forgive you; but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your
Father forgive your trespasses.&quot; How quickly the gracious promise had been
fulfilled in her case! Her heart, which had hardened to flint while cherishing
anger toward one whom she believed had injured her, grew tender and loving
under the softening influence of the spirit of forgiveness. No sooner did she
cast away the vile serpent which had coiled itself so closely around her vitals
as to crush out every vestige of affection, than the dove of peace flew down
and nestled in her bosom.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>To the chaplain Stella
had related some facts in the history of her early life, with a mere hint at
some events which had blasted her happiness. Only to the loved and trusted
friend of her own age, one who had secured a place for her in this happy home,
and brought her hither, had she confessed that her own temper, jealousy, and distrust
had greatly aggravated her sufferings. Mr. Owen knew enough to understand that,
whatever the past had been, she was now repentant, that she had listened to the
invitation, &quot;Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden,&quot; and
that Jesus Christ had given her rest.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In an interview with
the chaplain preparatory to her receiving the precious memorials of Christ's
love, she once more announced her faith in Christ as her only hope for a poor
sinner like herself, and her belief that He would answer her prayers for one
long lost to her, that, if he were still living, he would be brought to love her
Saviour, and to forgive her, as she had, from the heart, forgiven him.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The effect of this
service was so refreshing that for several days she was quite free from the
extreme suffering for breath which had so exhausted her. According to her
request, her friend, in one of her daily calls, had brought her paper and pens,
and, bolstered up in bed, she spent nearly an hour every day in writing.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The end came at last
unexpectedly. She was sitting nearly upright listening to the last chapters in
the Revelation, when, with a wave of her hand to stop the reading, she repeated
in a full voice the words just read: &quot;And God shall wipe away all tears
from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying;
neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things are passed
away.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She paused, raised her
eyes, a bright smile illumined her face; she pointed upward, then with a little
gasp her spirit fled away to the Saviour in whom she trusted.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Waiting only to ask
permission from the superintendent to pay all necessary expenses, and to learn
when the funeral services would be attended, her friend gazed for the last time
on the marble countenance, so peaceful in its calm repose, then, taking from
the nurse a package directed to her care, passed quietly from the room.</span></p>

<h1><a id="Part_1_Chapter_4"><span class='c8'>CHAPTER IV.</span></a></h1>

<h1><span class='c6'>ETHEL AND HER PASTOR.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>NOW that the
ordination services had passed, the young clergyman girded himself up for his
work among his people. It was his chosen work, and, could he have blotted a few
pages from the book of his past life, he would have gone forward with hope as
well as with courage. During the few days preceding the ordination, he humbled himself
before God, asking help of the Divine Spirit to search out whatever was wrong
in his heart and help him to overcome in whatever tempted him. Still there was
a kind of bewilderment in his mind, a kind of waiting to see whether his Father
in heaven, who knew every event of his life, might not interpose even yet and
by his providence send him back to his work among the poor in the city.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>During these days the
influence of the sweet child Ethel did much to quiet him and inspire him to
more confidence in gaining the affection of his people. She used to fix her
eyes so wistfully on his, as she sat opposite him at table, watching and
waiting for the smile which now and then flitted across his features,—a smile
not soon forgotten, so entirely did it change the whole expression of his
countenance. At his bidding she would come and nestle herself in his arms,
never obtruding herself on his notice, but quietly submitting to having her
hand held tenderly and occasionally put to his lips.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Her brother Joe, or
Gardner, as his mother called him, was rather a saucy boy, the only son, and of
course a great pet. When he thought Mr. Angus was out of the house, he would
march up and down the long hall singing,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Our pastor is a rare,
rare man,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He sings so fine you
cannot tell,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>His smile is bright as
bright can be,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>But then he only
smiles for Ethel.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Look here, I'll
tell you a secret,&quot; he said to Annie. &quot;My poetry will be the making
of me. I have succeeded so well in my first effort I intend to publish a book
of poems, and I shall dedicate it to the Rev. Harold Angus, who first inspired
my muse. Isn't that the way they put it?  I shall have, let me see, how many
copies printed for private use, one for mother, Marion, and you,&quot;—counting
on his fingers—&quot;one for Mr. Angus and Ethel, five, and I'll keep one for myself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Annie laughed
heartily, as she said, &quot;If the rest is as fine as your first verse, no
doubt there will be a great sale. I'm so glad Mr. Angus is to live here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Only for the
present. He said he wouldn't ask more, and then he whispered baby to plead for
him. Wasn't it funny how seriously the little puss took it? When she found
there was even a possibility of his going away, she walked right up to pa and
said,&quot;—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Do you want
your little girl to go way off?'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'No, puss, what
do you mean?'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Why, you know
if Mr. Angus goes I shall have to go. He can't go alone, and he hasn't any
little girl but me.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'In that case,'
pa said, 'the matter is soon settled; pa can't spare his baby any way.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In a few weeks the
Sunday school was completely reorganized. Every teacher was obliged to be
present at the teachers' meeting on Saturday afternoon, to be promptly in her
or his place every Sunday; or, if unable to do so, to send a substitute. A
Bible class for adults had been formed, taught by the pastor, and this soon outgrew
the accommodations in the Sunday-school room, and had to adjourn into the
church.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Here more than
anywhere else Mr. Angus felt at home. If it were a mistake for one with a past
like his to stand up in God's place, it certainly was right for him to help
others to study God's word, and so to study it that the effect on their lives
might be for the honor of Christ.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Honestly and truly, he
did try to throw off the burden which often weighed his spirits to the earth,
and yet there were hours when the agony of his mind was almost more than he
could bear, when he could only cry,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Dear Lord, Thou
knowest all. Put Thine almighty arm around me. Hear my prayers and grant me
relief. Visit not, O Lord, upon others the chastening for my deserts. Save me,
and I will praise Thy name for ever and ever.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Day by day he buried
himself in study or in visits among his people, Joe frequently conveying him to
the outskirts of the parish in his father's buggy.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>One afternoon he had
been alone to a distant part of the town, and was returning, when he stopped at
a small thread and needle store to purchase a pair of gloves. Behind the
counter was a young girl who attracted his attention by a peculiarly merry
expression. The color deepened in her cheeks as she took down box after box, searching
for the right number, and at last she asked him to excuse her ignorance, as she
was only a new hand.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;This pair seems
to be very elastic,&quot; she said, striving in vain to control the muscles of
her face, which, in spite of her efforts, dimpled and beamed in the most
mirth-provoking manner. She stretched the kid across the back of the glove, and
held it out to him, when he put out his hand for her to measure it. He could
scarcely help noticing that the fingers of the shop girl were beautifully
tapering, and that her one ring, though not a diamond, was large and costly.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Just as he was paying
for the gloves, a woman, fat and rosy, came bustling in, exclaiming, as she saw
what was passing,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Well, I never
did! Why, Miss—&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She checked herself
suddenly, warned by a glance from the young lady.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The clergyman had
scarcely reached the street when he heard the</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>woman's voice saying,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;That's the new
parson. Folks like him, mostly, though they do say he's kind o' stiff and
proud.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The reflections caused
by these words were not pleasant. It was possible that when his thoughts were
dwelling on his own painful experience his manner might be reticent. &quot;If
they consider me proud,&quot; was his reflection, &quot;how little they know
me! Why, I would exchange gladly with those rough boys playing ball yonder, if
by doing so I would get rid of these harrowing memories. Well, I owe my thanks
to the woman, though I suppose she scarcely intended that I should hear her
criticisms.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Then he began to
wonder who the shop girl could be. She was so evidently out of place there; and
what caused her mirth? Alone as he was, he laughed heartily as he recalled the
dimpled curves around that arch mouth, and wondered whether there had been any
reason personal to himself which brought these dimples into such full play.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Letting himself into
the house by his night-key, he went directly to his chamber, where he remained
until summoned by the bell to the tea-table. Ethel, at sound of his step,
rushed to the door to meet him, her voice ringing joyously as she exclaimed,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;My Marion has
come! I'll show her to you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Pulling him eagerly
forward, she brought him face to face again with—the shop girl; stood for an
instant gazing at them, then, in the fulness of her content, and wishing to
give one grand proof of her love, she added,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'll let you
kiss her if you want to.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>A burst of laughter
followed, during which Mr. Angus had time to catch the little girl in his arms
and whisper something in her ear, Marion, meanwhile, growing very rosy as she
waited for a formal introduction from her uncle.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;My niece, Miss
Howard, Rev. Mr. Angus, our pastor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The gentleman
cordially extended his hand. Their eyes met and they both laughed.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>After they were seated
at the table, Marion, who was sitting next her uncle and opposite the
clergyman, with a merry glance in his direction, explained:—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I have met Mr.
Angus before.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Where did you
meet him? In the city?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I had the
pleasure of purchasing a pair of gloves from the store where Miss Howard is
employed. I have tried on the gloves since,&quot; he added, glancing archly in
her blushing face, &quot;and I assure you they fit extremely well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion threw back her
head and laughed heartily, and as mirth is more contagious than any fever, all
present joined in the mirth, though there were loud calls for an explanation.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It is
only,&quot; she said, &quot;that I called on my way from the depot to see Mary
Falkner, and as her mother was very busy, I offered to sit by Mary's bed while
she finished her washing. Some one came into the shop. Mrs. Falkner was in the
clothes-yard, and did not hear, and I at last went forward, supposing, of
course, that I should be called on for a spool of thread or a paper of pins.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I am sorry, sir,
that I could not serve you better, but under the circumstances I did as well as
I knew how. But I am forgetting my errand to you. I charged you too much for
the gloves, and Mrs. Falkner trusted me with the change to be returned, which I
now make over to you&quot;; passing twenty-five cents in silver across the table.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I shall take an
early opportunity to show my appreciation of Mrs. Falkner's fair dealing,&quot;
responded Mr. Angus, smiling, as he put the silver in his pocket. But with an
instant change in his tone, &quot;Who is this Mary Falkner? Does she belong to
my charge?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, sir; she is
a poor cripple; so patient and cheerful, that it is a lesson to see her. It
almost brings tears to my eyes to hear her talk of God's mercy to her, and how
He inclines the hearts of people to supply her wants. Why, even the coming of
customers to the store for a few pennies' worth of thread is a subject for
thankfulness.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;She is, indeed,
to be envied. I regret that I have not seen her. Such calls are needed by a
pastor for his own good.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion's beaming face
bore witness to her approbation of this sentiment, as she remarked,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;There is no
place in the parish where a visit from you would be more prized than in poor
Mary's chamber.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Dear little Ethel, how
hard it was for her, during the few days of Marion's visit, to divide her
favors equally between her two friends. By this time the friendship between her
and her pastor had become very close. In a small locker under his bookcase were
some of her choicest toys, brought hither from time to time; and with these she
would amuse herself so quietly that he almost forgot her presence. During his
study hours he often rose from his books and paced the floor while he arranged
the topics of his sermons. One glance showed her he was busy, and she scarcely
moved. Sometimes he seated himself in a large chair for the same purpose, when
the little one, watching every movement, obeyed the motion of his hand, and
with her favorite dolly in her arms, silently crept to his lap, sitting so quiet
that she often fell asleep.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Once her father,
coming unexpectedly from his office to the house, inquired for her, and was
told she was with Mr. Angus in his study. The child heard his voice, and
putting her little fat hand on her mouth to keep herself quiet, went softly
from the room.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'm afraid you
will disturb Mr. Angus,&quot; her father said. &quot;What do you do in
there?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I keep stiller
than a mouse, 'cause they nibble cheese and I don't, and I make sermons with
Mr. Angus.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Make sermons,
eh?&quot; laughing; &quot;well, you'd better come with me and make the horse
go.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Now if she obeyed
Marion's invitation for a walk with her, she watched anxiously for any marks of
disapprobation from her other friend, nor was she quite satisfied until she had
made it clear to him that she loved him just the same, but that her Marion was
only going to be with her a little while, and would feel badly if she did not
go for a walk.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>To her cousin she also
explained why she did not as heretofore devote herself entirely to her society.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I have to take care
of him, you know, because he has nobody but me. He doesn't look as sorry as he
did. It always makes me cry to see tears roll down his cheeks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Cry!&quot;
repeated Marion, quite shocked.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes; when we're
praying to Jesus to make us good, he says we must always tell Jesus when we
have been naughty, and He will forgive us right off.&quot;</span></p>

<h1><a id="Part_1_Chapter_5"><span class='c8'>CHAPTER V.</span></a></h1>

<h1><span class='c6'>A HAPPY CHRISTIAN.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>


<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>FROM the first Marion
had been agreeably impressed with Mr. Angus; though after hearing from Aunt
Thankful of his first sermon and his cry for help after the evening service,
agreed with her aged friend that he must have known real sorrow; sorrow from
the effects of which he could not all at once rally. After hearing his prayers,
it seemed to her impossible to believe that his sorrow was caused by any act of
his own. If so, she was certain that it had been heartily repented of. The
scene so innocently referred to by Ethel took hold of her imagination. In the
solitude of his chamber he knelt, his little pet by his side, her hand held
fast in his, while tears ran down his cheeks, as he implored forgiveness for past
offences. Do what she would, she could not shake off the memories of this
scene.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion was young in
years, only twenty-three her next birthday; but her life had been an eventful
one. Blessed with Christian parents, her opening mind eagerly imbibed the
practical truths of the Bible. Jesus Christ was embraced as her Saviour from
sin in this life, and from the punishment of sin in the life to come. God was to
her a tender, loving Father, to whom she might go at any hour, with the same
freedom as she approached her earthly father. She realized in an unusual manner
His watchful providence, guiding and guarding her at every step of her young
life. When at the age of seventeen she was bereft of both her earthly parents,
she accepted in all their fulness the promises of God to the fatherless ones, and
never had these gracious promises failed.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Her education being
incomplete, her guardian' sent her to New York City to the care of her father's
sister, an amiable but thoroughly worldly woman. Mrs. Williamson considered her
duty accomplished when she had seen her niece arrayed in the most becoming
mourning attire, had entered her at a fashionable institution, and introduced
her to her own select circle.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>But these
surroundings, so unlike the quiet refinement of her own sweet home, instead of
weaning the young orphan from the pure pleasures of a Christian life, left her
with such a yearning for the society of those who sympathized in her dearest
joys that she resolved to spend more time than ever in communion with her Saviour.
Happy indeed are those who, losing Christian companionship, are driven for
comfort to Christ himself. His love can so fill the soul thus depending on Him
as to compensate for the loss of every earthly solace.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion was allowed to
choose her own church, and at once joined a Bible class, where her hunger for
instruction so animated her classmates and so encouraged her teacher that the
most happy results followed.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>During the hours in
the day devoted to secular studies Marion worked with all her might. She knew
it to be right to do her very best, and even with the branches of exact
science, which were irksome, she conquered her reluctance and soon made her
mark as a scholar of unusual ability.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Music was, however,
her specialty. It was passion with her, and even before her parents' death, her
skill as a pianist as well as her power with her voice distinguished her.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;How plainly I
can see a Father's hand leading me all the way through!&quot; she used to say.
&quot;He gave me the ability to sing, and when the right time came He allowed
me the privilege of using my voice for the comfort of others.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She alluded to the
fact of being invited by a gentleman connected with her Sunday school to sing
for the patients at the &quot;Home for the Sick.&quot; In connection with this
first visit she used to say,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Never did I know
such real happiness as when I found myself able to comfort those poor, weary
ones, Christ's own sufferers. When one woman, taking my hand, thanked me with
moistened eyes for the words of cheer, it was an impulse I could scarcely
resist to fall on my knees and thank her for letting me sing for her. 'You have
lighted the path to the grave. I'm not afraid now,' gasped one whose wings were
plumed for her flight.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh!&quot;
exclaimed Marion, clasping her hands to her breast as she recalled the scene.
&quot;Who am I, that I should be so blessed?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>During the summer
months Mr. Williamson usually travelled with his family or passed the time at
some fashionable resort, and it was his earnest wish that Marion should accompany
them.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>But after a week spent
at a gay hotel she told her uncle she found it unendurable; and insisted on
going alone, if he could not find an escort for her, to visit her Aunt Asbury.
She arrived when the whole family were watching the fading away of a young
life. Helen, the oldest daughter, about whom so many hopes had clustered, the
light of the home, the pride of parents and friends, had received a summons to leave
all that had hitherto been so dear and enter on the unknown,—the infinite.
Shuddering with fear, she turned to her parents for help, but they could only
weep and wring their hands. At length their clergyman was summoned, and from
this hour his visits were frequent. The knitted brow had given way to a calm
seriousness, as with trembling lips she said, &quot;I do believe Christ is my
Saviour, and that He will lead me safely home.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Her parents, too, if
not really submissive, were trying to say, &quot;Thy will be done.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The coming of Marion
at such a crisis was indeed a blessing. Her very first words as she sat down by
the bedside, after offering and receiving a loving embrace, lit up the face of
the dying girl with a ray of Heaven's own light.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;O Helen, how I
wish I could change places with you! Going home to Christ, to be with Him
forever, to see the dear saints who have gone before, to talk to them of what
Jesus has done for you, to sing with them the new song, 'Worthy the Lamb,' to
sit down by the beloved John, to see Peter and hear him repeat the story of his
grief at the denial of his Lord, to talk with Moses and Joseph and Samuel, to
think that you will be forever free from the struggles with sin, that you will
be holy as He is holy. Dear Helen, you are indeed to be envied.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, I can thank
God now.&quot; Helen's smile was radiant.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Tears were streaming
down Mrs. Asbury's cheeks, but wholly unconscious of them, the lady rose and
kissed Marion, saying softly,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Thank God you
have come! Your visit will do us all good.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Asbury had not
known much of his niece, though he was one of her guardians. He watched her
closely, trying to account for the change in his household. Every day rendered
it more certain that a grim messenger was hovering about, waiting for an
opportunity to enter, but his approach was no longer dreaded. The chamber where
the patient sufferer lay seemed the brightest in the house. Marion, who had constituted
herself chief nurse, went in and came out with a smile. Her voice was often
heard singing there, not sad, pensive strains, but notes with a ring of
triumph. The names of our blessed Lord, Jesus, Immanuel, Saviour, were
constantly repeated, and dwelt on lovingly. The very words seemed to give
strength, even in the lingering echoes.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>On one occasion, Mr.
Asbury, too anxious to remain long absent from the house, quietly entered the
chamber just as Marion began a familiar hymn. He had often heard it before, but
never with such a thrill as now. Even the dying girl was joining in the
singing.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;How sweet the
name of Jesus sounds</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In a believer's ear,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It soothes his sorrows,
heals his wounds,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And drives away his
fear.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It makes the
wounded spirit whole, </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And calms the troubled
breast; </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>'Tis manna to the
hungry soul, </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And to the weary,
rest.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Weak is the
effort of my heart,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And cold my warmest
thought;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>But when I see Thee as
Thou art,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>I'll praise Thee as I
ought.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Till then I
would Thy love proclaim </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>With every fleeting
breath; </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And may the music of
Thy name </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Refresh my soul in
death.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Gazing into that rapt
face, so elevated above all the pains and sorrows of earth, the father could
not doubt that the prayer in these last lines was answered. The soul was
refreshed, invigorated, and made infinitely blessed by the music of that
precious name. A prayer rose to Heaven from one hitherto unused to prayer,
&quot;Breathe, O Lord, into my soul such love for Thee as may fill my heart
with peace and joy when I go down to the dark valley.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The end came at last,
suddenly, though long looked for. The messenger was not unwelcome. He was
greeted with a smile so sweet, so rapt, that all gazed in wonder. Calmly the
dying girl put her hand in his, while Marion in a clear voice repeated the
inspired words, &quot;'Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil; for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort
me.'&quot;</span></p>

<h1><span class='c6'>THE MUSIC TEACHER.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>THE triumphant death
of the eldest daughter was followed by marked religious improvement in the
family. Both Mr. and Mrs. Asbury publicly confessed their faith in Christ. The
family altar was erected with this inscription, &quot;As for me and my house,
we will serve the Lord.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion, too, received
a new impetus in her chosen work,—the work of a soul-winner.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I want to be a
missionary,&quot; was her reply to her uncle, when he was urging her to remain
permanently in his family. &quot;I have already begun to make many projects
for the poor in New York City.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;But, Marion, you
are too young, too attractive, to go alone among the poor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Don't say too
attractive, uncle. I want to be as attractive as possible. Understand me,&quot;
she added, laughing, with a visible heightening of color, &quot;I want to be
loved and trusted; and I thank God that I am—am not repulsive in appearance.
Too young I certainly am to go alone; and that is why I have kept dear old
Hepsey.  Aunty thinks me obstinate, incorrigible, because I don't dismiss the poor
old creature, as she calls her, and have a fashionable French maid. Dear aunty!
I'm afraid she would think me a fit subject for the lunatic asylum if she knew
where Hepsey and I go.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'm afraid, Marion,
that I shall have to agree with Mrs. Williamson that you are a little wilful.
Put yourself in my place, and ask yourself whether it would be right for me to
consent to your going into those infected regions in New York. You might catch
small-pox, or cholera, or something dreadful.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She caught his arm,
and gave it a loving squeeze, then with an arch glance in his face, exclaimed,
&quot;You ought to praise me for telling you all this. I have never told Uncle
nor Aunt Williamson. But seriously, uncle, I haven't a particle of fear. The
sanitary arrangements in a city like New York are excellent. I love life too well,
and I have too great a work in it to put myself in danger. Besides, I have the
earnest approval of dear Helen. I talked with her more freely than I ever did
with any one, and she, standing on the border land between this life and the
next, with Heaven's own light on her, said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Go on, Marion.
Yours is a blessed work. God will protect you in it.' Oh, how that benediction
has encouraged me!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>What could Mr. Asbury
answer to such pleading?</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And so Marion had gone
on, from step to step, till Mr. Williamson was fain to resign his ward to other
and firmer hands. Her aunt, having exhausted all the adjectives in her
denunciations, and having informed her thousand and one friends that her niece
was a bigoted fanatic, who, if permitted, would convert their house into an
asylum for paupers, coolly turned her back upon her, entirely ignoring her existence.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In consequence of all
this, Marion's twenty-first birthday found her in apartments of her own, with
Hepsey for her confidential adviser; not satisfied, as her aunt explained, with
a life of luxurious refinement, such as befitted her wealth and position in
society, but actually engaged as music teacher in Madame La Vergne's institute.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>This last step,
indeed, had been earnestly protested against by her Uncle Asbury, and she was
obliged to bring all her powers of coaxing, arguing, and pleading to bear upon
him before he would yield a reluctant consent.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;These young
girls are just entering life,&quot; was her concluding plea, &quot;without
either chart or compass to guide them. They will by and by exert a powerful
influence either for good or evil.  In no other way can I so readily gain an
influence over them. If I can win only one of them to higher aims in life, will
it not be worth the effort?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Even Mrs. Asbury
expostulated with her niece. &quot;You are free,&quot; she urged, &quot;to go
into any society you please, and you surely can find young ladies quite as much
in need of good influences as those connected with Madame La Vergne's school.
You will, when too late, perhaps, find it very irksome to be confined to
certain hours.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Now aunty, dear,
don't you turn against me. I have thought so much of this plan, and my
conscience approves, but I want your approval also. Well, I may as well confess
it; there are certain reasons why I want to influence these particular girls,
two of whom are in danger. They were my pets when I was their schoolmate, and
think I have already gained their confidence.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;After all that
is said,&quot; resumed Mr. Asbury &quot;you have power to do as you please. You
are absolutely your own mistress, with an independent fortune, but—&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion drew up her
queenly form and for an instant looked seriously displeased, but quickly
recovering herself, said, &quot;I'm sure, uncle, you do not mean to hurt me.
You and aunty are all I have who really and truly love me, so if you positively
refuse your consent to my devoting a few hours in a day to an employment which
is congenial to me, with the hope of being useful to two motherless girls, I
will relinquish my project.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. and Mrs. Asbury
glanced at each other as Marion quietly left the room, when with a laugh the
gentleman said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What a way the
girl has of carrying all before her. She must try her plan, I suppose. I wonder
who those two girls are.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And Marion did try it.
How well she succeeded in her efforts for their good will be revealed in the
pages of our book. Her life was a busy one. Often, when she retired to rest,
both body and brain were weary, and yet she was very happy. In her own home she
tended her flowers and fed her birds with a song on her lips. She met her friends
with a smile so sweet, joyous, and free from care that they envied her.
Naturally, she was overflowing with fun; indeed, her vivacity, her quickness at
repartee, made her the life of any circle, and her company, while she resided
with her uncle, was sought by the young of both sexes.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It was not her
intention to exclude herself wholly from society, but she was resolute in her
determination not to become a slave to fashion, the degrading effects of such
slavery having, even at her age, been forced on her notice.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I never saw any
one who enjoyed life more than Miss Howard,&quot; was the remark of an old
gentleman, after watching her at a musical party. She was surrounded by a group
of young people to whom she was relating a story, the arch expression on her
face bringing into play all her dimples. Gradually one and another, some
advanced in life, drew nearer, eager to share in the enjoyment. Perceiving
this, Marion skilfully drew her story to a close, and engaged others in conversation,
asking questions, and showing herself so anxious to please that a half-hour
passed most delightfully.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Singular being,&quot;
muttered Mr. Lambert, an irascible old man who had been introduced to her.
&quot;Not a word of scandal, thirty-five minutes, and no gossip. Pshaw! Fact,
no talk about religion either. A strange fanatic that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Stranger still,
perhaps, that the old man persistently lingered in the neighborhood of Miss
Howard, leaning forward to catch every word, drinking in the musical ripple of
laughter, which Marion's friends used to call one of her greatest charms,
watching the pure, fresh countenance, the merry, earnest eyes, until the ice
about his heart began to thaw. When they parted, to no one's surprise more than
to his own, he extended his hand, and gave hers a warm pressure as he said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I am glad that I
have met one who has no trouble.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I am an
orphan,&quot; responded Marion, tears suddenly dimming her eyes, &quot;but I
have a dear Father who is so very good to me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You do love life
then, even though your parents have left you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>There was a touch of
sarcasm in his voice which made her pity him.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh, yes; I am
very happy to be alive. There is so much to be done. I envy nothing so much as
the leisure hours some do not know what to do with. Yes, it is good to
live.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What can you
find to employ other people's leisure beside your own?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She gave one quick, earnest
glance into his face, paused a moment, and then answered,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I try to make
others happy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She was turning away
when he caught her hand, and with a strange twitching around his mouth, said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You seem to be
in earnest. I, who doubt every one, find it hard to doubt you. If you mean that
you try to help the poor, you will find it a thankless task. It doesn't
pay.&quot; There was intense bitterness in his tone.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;But, my dear
sir, that is because you go to the wrong paymaster. He has promised that even a
cup of cold water given for His sake shall receive its reward.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Poor man!
Doubting every one, endured only for the sake of your money; how I pity
you,&quot; was Marion's reflection, as she drove swiftly with Hepsey beside
her. &quot;I wish I could give you a lesson in true happiness. I'll try!&quot;</span></p>

<h1><a id="Part_1_Chapter_7"><span class='c8'>CHAPTER VII.</span></a></h1>

<h1><span class='c6'>GAMES AND ENTERTAINMENTS.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>ALL this had occurred
long before our first introduction to the young lady. She still continued to
give lessons in music at Madame La Vergne's school, but received no compensation
except in the case of three wealthy pupils. The amount received from these
three just defrayed the expense for tuition, etc., for two misses she was educating.
One of these, Annie Leman, gave promise of great proficiency in music.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion had speedy
occasion to remember her resolution with regard to Mr. Lambert. She was making
some visits in a street crowded with tenement houses, and had for the moment
become separated from Hepsey. With a basket on her arm she was trying to make
her way up a crazy flight of stairs when she heard a quick step behind her.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You have caused
me a pretty race,&quot; shouted a man's voice, which she instantly recalled as
belonging to her irascible friend. &quot;Good for heart complaint, very!&quot;
putting his hand upon his breast and breathing quickly. Possessing himself of
her basket, he lifted the cover, and said with a sneer, &quot;Just as I
supposed; tea and sugared dainties—ought to be arrested—idiotic—pests to
society—humbug—sentiment and nonsense!&quot; He was muttering away, when he caught
her look of pity, which rendered him furious.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;How dare you
come here?&quot; he shouted. &quot;You, who claim to belong to decent society.
You, a chit of a girl, alone and unprotected in such a region of filth and
pollution.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion's cheeks
flushed with anger, and she was going to retort in a like strain, but something
in his appearance checked her.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He looked so thin and
wan and friendless. Suddenly the anger faded away and with a smile she held out
her hand for the basket, saying playfully,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;If you had waited
a minute, you would have seen that I am not alone here; and I have good company
while you are near to protect me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Nonsense!&quot;
His mouth twitched and she was sure his eyes twinkled at this unexpected
retort. When finding herself mistress of the situation, she asked,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;How dare you
come here? It is very dangerous,&quot; pointing to the staircase, which Hepsey
at this moment was trying to climb.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Saw you—thought
you—danger—better send police—not fit for one of your sex.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He turned off into one
of the filthy rooms, and they heard him scolding the inmates as though he
enjoyed it.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What a
brute!&quot; muttered Hepsey; but Marion Only laughed, adding, &quot;I'm not a
bit afraid of him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>As they were leaving
the court he came up out of a cellar and joined them.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Delightful
vicinity; very healthy, too!&quot; pointing to a stagnant pool of filth in
which a pig was wallowing. He shrugged his shoulders, chuckling with mirth.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I see you enjoy
it as much as we do, Mr. Lambert. It's so good for the spirits to see people
enjoying themselves.&quot; A group of boys were playing marbles on the uneven
pavement, and scarcely moved for them to pass.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Get out of the
path,&quot; he shouted, striking his cane right and left. &quot;Don't you see
you're in the way of your betters?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh, Mr.
Lambert!&quot; exclaimed Marion, &quot;you have hurt that boy,&quot; as one of
the lads put his hand to his head, sending after them a terrible oath.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Pshaw! they're
not tender—good for them—business to get out of the way.&quot; But when they
were about to turn out of the street and parted company, they saw him hurrying
back to the group, shaking his cane and shouting, &quot;Wait! Wait!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Curious to know what
he would do, Marion went back to the head of the street, and saw the eccentric
old man throw a handful of coins to the boys, as he could not get them to wait
for another beating.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What a
disappointed life he must have had,&quot; she said to Hepsey, after walking in
silence for some minutes. &quot;I wonder whether he has any heart left.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Not likely,
miss,&quot; was the brief reply.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>A few weeks later
Marion was having quite a jubilee in her parlors. She had invited all the older
classes in the mission school, and was entertaining them with a play called
&quot;Shadows.&quot; At the end of the back parlor was a wide door across which
a white curtain was stretched, and the children sitting in the darkened rooms
saw behind the curtain scenes which made them open both eyes and mouth in
astonishment. A man was sitting in a chair in a doctor's office and the
physician was examining him. First the outside of his head, then the inside,
taking out with pincers, one tooth after another and putting them in again,
taking from the patient's throat tumblers, plates, long-handled kitchen spoons,
a hammer, and at last an umbrella, which had to be pulled and jerked, till the
patient shrieked.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>They were in the midst
of all this when Marion heard a familiar voice muttering,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Fool's
play,—miserable waste—time,—money,—better send them to the penitentiary at
once.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Since their late
interview Marion had thought much of the strange, lonely old man, and had
nearly made up her mind that he only tried to disguise his real feelings by his
outlandish manner.  She gave him her hand cordially, as she said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I did not invite
you to my party, Mr. Lambert, but I am very glad you came. I was just needing
some help.  My doctor in there needs a new patient: come, I will introduce you
to him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Patient, eh!
Well, I need a doctor badly enough. What do you want me to do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Only to have
your head cut off, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Hem! modest
request,—very civil, must say. My head is as 'valuable to me as—yours, for
instance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>But he followed her to
the hall, from which they could pass to the room in the rear.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Your head will
be restored in as good a condition as it is now,&quot; she explained, with an
arch smile.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Presently the children
saw the old gentleman take his seat in the chair, his long beard distinctly
visible through the curtain.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What do you
complain of?&quot; they heard the doctor ask.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Liver!&quot;
shouted the patient. &quot;Haven't slept a wink for ten years.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Not liver, but
conscience,—diseased conscience.&quot; This was Miss Howard's voice. &quot;It
needs reorganizing, sir. It affects the whole body, sir. I shall begin with the
head and cut away all the diseased part until we come to soundness, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Is this the way
you treat your patients? I'll not stand it. Cut off my head, indeed!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Absolute
necessity, sir. If you wish to be cured, there must be no delay.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Pretty sight for
the public,—man minus head.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;My salve, sir,
my famous Royal Recuperative Salve, known throughout the world, sir, will make
your head grow again in a few hours, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Don't believe a
word of such humbug; but cut away; something must be done.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The spectators held
their breath as they saw the knife cut deep into the flesh, then heard the saw
cracking the bone, and, presently, after a terrible groan, the head was severed
from the body and thrown to the floor.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Just in time,
sir,&quot; exclaimed the doctor, cheerfully.  &quot;Disease checked in time;
heart and lungs, and liver too, all right. Now for the salve!&quot;  They saw
him rub the neck thoroughly with ointment from a box, and then the patient was
carefully moved from the chair.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The children remained
in their seats awestruck, but the gas was relit and Miss Howard came into the
parlor looking particularly smiling. Wonder of wonders. It was scarcely fifteen
minutes before the patient appeared, leaning on the arm of the doctor, his head
erect and firm as ever.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Miraculous
cure,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Yes, I'll write an account for your advertising
paper. Head all right; little tenderness here, that's all,&quot; pointing to
his throat.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Then,&quot; said
Dr. James, laughing heartily, as he took off his false mustache, &quot;I will
bid you good day, sir, and wish you joy of your new head.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Lambert threw
himself into a chair and went off into convulsions of laughter.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Outdoes the
theatre by all odds. Hurrah for the Royal Recuperative Salve to cure diseased
consciences! I'll take twenty bottles! Hurrah!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In the mean time
Marion took the children behind the curtain and explained to them the method by
which these wonders were accomplished. She recalled James, to show them that he
only passed his hand down by the side of the throat, when Hepsey, concealed
from view, passed to him tumblers, umbrella, etc., all of which, in the shadow,
seemed to come from the throat.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The decapitated head
was made of pasteboard, cut to resemble an old man with a beard.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The apartments
occupied by Marion were situated in a fashionable part of the city. Wishing to
be entirely independent, and yet desirous of avoiding the publicity of a hotel,
she had persuaded Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell, friends of her parents, to hire this
house next to a hotel and allow her the entire use of the second floor. Her
meals being sent in from the table d'hôte, she could indulge her hospitality without
burdening her friends, who were advanced in age. Besides Hepsey, she had a boy
of sixteen years, whom she employed in various ways, accompanying her in stormy
weather in her visits to the poor, going errands, etc. This boy, Jim, or, as
she called him, James Kelly, was one of the first-fruits of her mission work,
and, being an orphan like herself, she was deeply interested in his welfare.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>At the death of her parents,
their home in the country was rented, the furniture, with the exception of
certain costly articles, pictures, etc., being allowed to remain in the house.
These had been brought to the city, and now beautified her pleasant home.
Marion had a passion for flowers, and at her own expense had built out from her
parlor a small conservatory, which was filled with her favorite plants. One
seldom saw her without a bud of some kind doing service for a brooch at her
throat; and in her calls upon the sick, a few fresh-cut violets or a sweet
rose-bud proved a great help in gaining the confidence she so earnestly sought.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Believing, as she did,
that our social qualities were given us to be cultivated, our young friend gave
frequent entertainments, always supported by the presence of Mr. and Mrs.
Mitchell. To further her own plans she selected games, encouraged charades,
improvised characters, occasionally taking part herself, on which occasions she
abandoned herself to the enjoyment with the freshness of a child.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I believe,&quot;
she responded to a Christian friend, who was taking her to task for encouraging
a taste for the theatrical,—&quot;I believe that I have done more good by my
charades than I could have hoped for in any other way. In one instance I have
in mind, at a critical period for a young favorite, I persuaded her to come to
a charade I got up especially for her; and I am satisfied the result was happy.
She was in danger of giving way to evil influences; her conscience troubled her;
she became very irritable. I had a little talk with her, took her with me to
visit a poor family, who were indeed rich in faith, and then invited her to my
entertainment. She came to me the second day after and, with a burst of joyful
tears, threw herself into my arms, exclaiming,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'I'm so happy:
the struggle is over.  Oh, I can never tell you how I thank you!' She had given
up the acquaintance of one who was leading her astray, who would have made her
a wretched husband, who had denounced Christians as gloomy fanatics, who considered
laughing a sin, etc. My party, mirthful and gay as it was, commended itself to her
conscience; even the play itself conveyed to her excited mind a high moral
sentiment, as I had intended. She went home, passed the night pacing the floor,
while she asked help of God to decide aright. She is now an earnest, cheerful,
Christian worker. Unsolicited, she left the fashionable church which she had
been attending, and is my powerful alto singer at our mission.&quot;</span></p>

<h1><a id="Part_1_Chapter_8"><span class='c8'>CHAPTER VIII.</span></a></h1>

<h1><span class='c6'>PLEASANT PROJECTS.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>ON Ethel's fifth
birthday she claimed the promise of her mother,—that she should sit up to
family prayers. Except on Sunday night, when supper was served at an earlier
hour than on other days, it was her habit to eat her simple meal of bread and
milk and be in bed before the ringing of the supper-bell.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Sitting up for prayers
was quite an era in her young life. No sooner was the meal concluded than she
brought her low chair and placed it close to Mr. Angus. It was the custom to
sing a hymn before reading the Scriptures, and the pastor held the book so that
Ethel could look on the page with him. As he named the hymn he merely remarked,
&quot;It is pleasant to have all join in this social worship.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The child, considering
herself included in this invitation, as indeed she was, began in a low timid
tone to sing her own little hymn, but presently, becoming used to the sound of
her voice, sang so loud as almost to drown the tones of the piano, upon which
Annie was playing. Over and over again she repeated the words, &quot;Jesus,
come and make me good, good, Jesus come and make me good.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The tune as well as
the words were improvised for the occasion, and did not in the least chord with
the notes they were singing. Most of those present smiled, Gardner tittered
behind his book and about Mr. Angus's mouth a suspicious twitching was noticed,
but no one interfered with the child's evident enjoyment of the occasion.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'm quite
sure,&quot; remarked Mr. Angus afterward, as he seated Ethel on his knee,
&quot;that Jesus will hear and answer your prayer. Would you like to learn a
hymn to sing with us? Ask your sister to teach you one, and you can learn the
tune also. You have a very good voice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;A powerful one,
certainly,&quot; added her father, laughing.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Angus early formed
the acquaintance of Mary Falkner, the crippled girl. As Marion had told him,
she was truly happy, though at times a great sufferer. In every event of her
life she recognized a Father's loving, protecting hand, and was so truly
thankful for every favor received that it was a privilege to bestow kindness.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>On one occasion, when
the pastor was sitting by her bedside, realizing, as afterward he insisted,
that he was receiving rather than giving consolation, the door softly opened
and Marion, unannounced, walked in. Perceiving the visitor, she was retiring
when Mr. Angus rose to leave.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Don't go,
please,&quot; Mary said to Marion, &quot;I was just intending to ask the pastor
to pray.&quot;  </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Angus gave the
sick girl his hand when his prayer was concluded saying, as he bent over-her,
&quot;Remember your promise to pray for me; pray that, whether led through a
stony or a flowery path, I may have my Father's guidance as you have.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion drew near the
bedside as the pastor left the room, and was not surprised at the enthusiasm
manifested for him by the cripple.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;He is such a
kind friend, so humble, so devout. His prayers raise me to heaven; and he is
mindful of my earthly wants too. Look here,&quot; taking from an envelope a
piece of silver, &quot;he always leaves a token behind him, laying it on my
pillow without a word,—sometimes a dollar, never less than half a dollar.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I was
sure,&quot; answered Marion, in a hearty voice, &quot;that he would be a comfort
to you. You like him so much, I have a great mind to ask you a question. Have
you ever noticed any peculiarity in his prayers or in his manner?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Tears gushed to Mary's
eyes which no physical suffering could have forced from them, and, clasping her
hands, she exclaimed, &quot;Oh, how I wish I could comfort him! And he says I
have. He has a deep, abiding sorrow. It is living sorrow, too. It cannot be
grief for the dead. Once he quite forgot that I was present, and he prayed; but
it is too sacred to repeat. Oh, how my heart ached for him!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mary covered her face
and wept.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I wish he would
unburden his heart to you, Mary. I'm sure you could comfort him. He is a puzzle
to me. There is a weight on his spirits. I have seen an expression of agony
come over his face when he thought himself unobserved. Well, we can pray God to
appear for him. I have never spoken of him in this way before.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Grief is too
sacred to meddle with, at least such grief as his, Marion. I have told my
Saviour about it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>When the young lady
left the humble roof she repaired to the station near by to get her satchel,
and found Mr. Angus just sending a telegram to the city. He advanced eagerly to
meet her, holding out his hand.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You are the very
one to advise me,&quot; he said, his whole face beaming. &quot;I am a poor
physician, but I know something of medicine. I have learned about Mary's case,
and I do not feel hopeless of her recovery. You live in the city of New York,
and have probably heard of the Home for the Sick.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Certainly I
have. I often go there to visit my sick friends.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Then you will
agree with me that, if I can procure a place for her in that Christian home,
she will have a fair chance for recovery.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Strange I never
thought of it before,&quot; murmured Marion, as though speaking to herself.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Not at all
strange. It did not occur to me till this morning, and I have just written a message
to Dr. B-, the superintendent, asking to have a surgeon sent to examine the
case. I have myself been an inmate of the Home, and have the most entire
confidence in the care and skill she would receive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Will they send
so far, Mr. Angus? I mean, will there not be great expense? Excuse me, but I
would advise another plan. Mary is a great favorite of mine; indeed, I am under
obligations to her. There is an eminent surgeon in the next town, whom I will
take to see her this very day. If he gives us hope, I will go to the hospital
at once on my return to the city. I only wish I had thought of it years
ago.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>A curious expression
on Mr. Angus's face startled Marion, with a slight shrug of the shoulders,
which was strangely familiar to her. It was as though he had said,—&quot;You are
taking the matter out of my hands with a vengeance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion laughed aloud.
&quot;Don't think me officious in meddling with your plan,&quot; she urged.
&quot;I'm a teacher, you know, and accustomed to give orders.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I shall at least
claim the pleasure, Miss Howard, of bearing the expense necessary for placing
her in the Home.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'll see about
that.&quot; Marion gave one of those arch glances which brought her dimples
into full play. When she smiled, it was like a child's face, pure and fresh,
and sweet and loving. For one moment, as he gazed, Mr. Angus forgot his burden.
There might yet be something bright for him in life. With a deep sigh he
shouldered his burden again, and this time it seemed weightier than ever
before.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>They walked in silence
for a time, the young lady puzzling herself to account for the strange
associations connected with that peculiar expression on Mr. Angus's face which
had so startled her. Somehow it was connected with the Home for the Sick.
Rousing herself, and forgetting that his thoughts had not followed hers, she
asked,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Is it long since
you were an inmate?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Do you mean of
the hospital?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It is five years
this very month.  It was there I was healed not only in the body, but the soul.
Never did any poor mortal need a divine physician more than I did. Words cannot
express my gratitude that a merciful Father directed me to that spot. The
faithful chaplain found me weighed to the ground, and persuaded me to allow an Almighty
Arm to be placed beneath me. Pardon me,&quot; he added, suddenly interrupting
himself, &quot;I did not remember that to a stranger this must be a wearisome
story. I am not used to forget myself in this way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He turned toward her a
face drawn with pain, to meet eyes full of sympathy, and when she murmured
softly the words, &quot;I am not a stranger, I am a friend,&quot; his feelings
almost overcame him.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Thank you,&quot;
he said, extending his hand, but instantly withdrawing it; then, controlling
himself by a visible effort, went on, &quot;I found my Saviour within those
blessed walls, and was encouraged both by the pastor and chaplain to hope that,
by consecrating my life to the service of my divine Master, I might be useful
to some poor soul as burdened as myself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Has not that
hope been fulfilled, Mr. Angus? Has not Jesus Christ kept his gracious promise
to you and given you rest? Pardon me, I am a missionary too. I have thought
much of you, and prayed for you, as I do for all my friends. I have feared
that—that you have not cast all your burden upon Him. You are trying to bear
part of it alone. Sorrow or sin He has atoned for and has promised to take. Oh,
do give it all up to Him! For your own sake, for the sake of those in your charge,
I entreat you, try His love in all its fulness. It cannot, will not, fail you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Her voice trembled in
her eagerness. Suddenly catching a glimpse of his pallid countenance, she
stopped short in her walk.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You will
forgive, you will understand me,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;I for a moment forgot
that I am too young to advise you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Miss Howard,
even you will turn from me in despair when I ask, can these hands, which have
shed the blood of a brother, ever be clean? Even you have seen the mark of Cain
on my brow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Startled as she was,
Marion realized that in order to give comfort to this burdened soul, she must
control herself. With a face blanched, and shaking voice, she repeated the
gracious promise,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Him that cometh
to me I will in no wise cast out.' Such a promise holds good, even to the
shedder of blood.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Do not
understand,&quot; he exclaimed, in great excitement, &quot;that it was prompted
by malice. It was an accident. I—But the scene is too ghastly to recall. To no
mortal have I ever breathed the words before. Into the ears of a merciful God I
pour my complaint day and night.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Into Marion's eyes
came a strange light. The color surged back into her face. Memories of the
past, forgotten for years, came rushing over her. She was wholly unaware that
she had stopped again, that her eyes were fixed on his, that she was trying to
read his very thoughts. It required a great effort to come back to present realities.
&quot;I must say something,&quot; was her reflection. &quot;Oh, that I was
sure! God grant I may be!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Mr. Angus,&quot;
she began, her face beaming with a strange expression of hope and tenderness, &quot;forgive
me for saying it, you have grown morbid, brooding over your past. With all my
heart I thank you for your confidence, which I consider as sacred as the grave.
Let me say that I look forward confidently to the hour when the sorrow which
has weighed you down to the dust will be driven away like the morning cloud.
Pray for that time as though you believed God has power to help you. Have
entire faith in His promise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Before he could answer
she had turned into side path and was presently lost to view.</span></p>

<h1><span class='c6'>THE DOCTOR'S DIAGNOSIS.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>ON going to dinner,
Marion was not much surprised to hear that the pastor had requested to be
excused from the table on the plea of a headache. Mrs. Asbury was preparing tea
and toast, which the servant stood waiting to take up on a tray. At this moment
Ethel came running up, her face flushed, exclaiming,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Mamma, may I
stay with Mr. Angus? He is sitting in the chair with his eyes shut, and he
looks real sick.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'll carry the
tray myself,&quot; said Mrs. Asbury, glancing at her husband. &quot;No, Ethel,
stay here till I come back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;He is worse than
usual,&quot; she explained presently, as she brought back the food untouched.
&quot;Ethel, dear, as soon as you have eaten, you may go to him. Strange what
an influence she has,&quot;—turning to the family. &quot;He asked it as a
favor, if I could spare her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. and Mrs. Asbury
were so occupied with anxiety about Mr. Angus, whose strength seemed always on
the point of giving way, that they did not notice Marion's abstraction. As they
were rising from the silent meal, she asked,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Can I have the
horse and buggy, uncle? I want to drive to N—. I am going for Dr. Moore to see
Mary Falkner.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Why not ask him
to make a professional call on Mr. Angus?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You might
propose it to him, but I doubt whether he would require a surgeon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;That's so; but I
mean to have a serious talk with him as soon as he recovers from this attack.
It is wicked for him to neglect these warnings.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Annie eagerly offered
to accompany Marion to N—; but she only desired to be alone to have time to
recall fleeting memories, to reconcile coincidences, and decide how it was best
for her to make her surmises known to Mr. Angus.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She had driven slowly
over the four miles to N— before her final decision was reached. It would be
cruel to hold out hopes which might prove fallacious. &quot;No, I must go home,
to make sure. Then, if it be as I hope and believe what a joy.&quot; Marion
stopped, wholly unable to express in words the deep emotions which agitated
her. All the time she was tying her horse to the post, she was saying to
herself,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Did she mean
murder? An accident is not murder.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It was with a real
effort that she roused herself to tell the physician her errand.  He had just
returned from a long drive to visit a patient, and told her he would accompany
her at once after eating his dinner, and return in the cars.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>On the way Marion
related all that she knew of Mary's case, and then described the arrangements
at the Home for the Sick.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Her enthusiasm made
him laugh. &quot;I know all about that,&quot; he explained. &quot;I was one of
the staff of house surgeons there at one time, and I can say it is truly a
home. Very few, even of the wealthiest, can command the care and skill which
falls to the lot of the poorest patient there. I remember a wealthy lady coming
with a valuable servant who had fractured her arm. When the patient was
comfortably placed in bed she was leaving the room, when she met Dr. B-, the pastor
and superintendent.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'I want to
recommend to your special attention the woman I have just brought here,' she
began.”</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Certainly,
madam,' was his polite answer as he passed into the ward, 'certainly; all our
patients have special attention. She shall be well cared for.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I have taken
many patients there,&quot; rejoined Marion, her eye kindling with pleasure.
&quot;I should say that if there were any favorites, they are the very sickest
and poorest, and sometimes the most repulsive. But after all, the care of their
bodies is only one part. They are led to think of the end of life, and in their
enforced seclusion, with the most loving influences about them, they often,
very often, come to better thoughts of their Maker, and go out with new hopes
and new resolutions in regard to life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Dr. Moore was
introduced to the patient by Marion, who only said that he had called as her
friend, to find out whether she could be relieved by treatment from her spasms
of pain. He made a careful diagnosis of her case, after which he gave her some
powders for temporary relief, bade her take courage, and returned to Marion, who
was waiting in the buggy.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I have been to
the station, Doctor,&quot; she explained &quot;and there is no train to N- for
a couple of hours, so I will take you home. I see by your face that you have
good news for me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Nonsense! A
doctor's face goes for nothing. He has to train it to look expressionless, or
he would soon get into trouble.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You can't
deceive me, Doctor. I know you are going to say she can be relieved.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I will say more.
She will always be lame, one limb being shorter than the other, but, with the
help of a thick sole to her shoe, I don't see why she should not walk about
with as little difficulty as you and I do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion gave a cry of
joy, clasping her hands. &quot;O Doctor!&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;what a
blessed profession yours is! If I were a man I would be a physician before any
other calling. I do thank you so much. How soon may I take her to New
York?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I've been
thinking,&quot; he said, gayly, &quot;of indulging myself with a trip to the
city. How would it do for you to see Dr. B— and engage a bed for her, and leave
me to take her there?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Will you,
Doctor?&quot; She gave him a glance brimful, overflowing with delight, and he
answered,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, I will do
all that. I shall be glad of the opportunity to see the Home once more. Now
Marion, I have earned a right to ask you a question. Why don't you get
married?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion threw back her
head and laughed heartily. &quot;Your question is so entirely unexpected,
Doctor, that I shall have to think before I answer. Well, first, I am too busy
to go about the country and select the right man. Second, I have formed such an
elevated idea of the being whom I would be willing to see in that relation,
that in case I had leisure I should be appalled at the difficulties in my path.
Thirdly, I am just as happy now as I can be. I have my good old Hepsey and
James Kelly, and all my poor people to take care of now. I'm sure I can't
imagine what I should do, even with my ideal man.&quot; The laugh which
followed was heart whole.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Nevertheless,&quot;
urged Dr. Moore, &quot;describe this ideal man to me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;His image is
scarcely distinct enough for that. First of all, he must be a man who loves God
and his neighbor as himself, as our Saviour has commanded.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Humph! I don't
know him, but go on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;He must be both
strong and tender, firm and gentle, courageous, kind, and courteous, capable of
sympathy both in joy and grief. He must be humble in his opinion of
himself.&quot;  Here a sudden reflection checked her, and she added, softly,
&quot;Not too humble,&quot; then came to an abrupt pause.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Appearance and
manners,&quot; suggested the doctor, without glancing at her.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Poor or rich is
of no consequence; but he must have ability. Whatever his calling is, he must
excel in it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Physician
preferred, probably.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Ye-es, or some
kindred profession.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Lawyer,
eh?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;No; oh, no,
indeed, not a lawyer!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Minister to a
foreign court, perhaps?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;No, not
connected with politics in any way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;There is nothing
left but a shoemaker, or a country parson. Merchants of every grade watch the
bills in Congress with eagle eyes. But how does he look?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Like an
athlete.&quot; Suddenly catching a twinkle in her companion's eye, Marion's
cheeks and brow became suffused, and she burst out, &quot;How ridiculous I have
made myself! I never thought so much of my husband before in all my life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'm well
acquainted with him,&quot; said the doctor, demurely. &quot;He's all right;
even your parents would be satisfied with him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What can you
mean, Doctor?&quot; She was startled now. &quot;Was there ever such a
man?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>They had reached his
home, and he quietly resigned the lines to her hand. Just as he stepped to the
ground, he fixed an earnest eye on her as he said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;The portrait is
excellent, even to the too humble.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Doctor! Dr.
Moore!&quot; called out Marion, as with an arch smile he was turning away,
&quot;you haven't given me your bill. I shall go to-morrow to see Dr. B--, and
will write you at once; A friend of Mary's is to bear all expenses of her
recovery; and, Doctor, I haven't told you how very, very grateful I am to
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;For approving
your choice of a husband?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You know,
Doctor, I was thinking of some thing very remote from an ideal man, whom it is
very unlikely I shall ever see. I may tell Mary now, mayn't I?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Certainly. And
in the pleasure you will have in telling her the good news, you will forgive an
old friend of your father for making a careful diagnosis of your heart.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He gave her another
quizzical glance and turned away.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;How absurd he
is!&quot; murmured the young lady. &quot;How could I have been betrayed into
such nonsense? I wonder whether he was in earnest, in saying he knew any one to
whom the description would fit. He would be a wonder of goodness, and I—&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Here Marion astonished
the faithful old horse, who was going on in his quiet jog, by a sudden jerk of
the lines and a peremptory order to quicken his pace. On consulting her watch,
she found it nearly five o'clock. She must call at the thread and needle store,
give Mary the joyful hope recovery, and then hasten home.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>To one who is always
looking to her Father in heaven for the gifts which flow into her daily life it
is not surprising, but only an increased reason for gratitude, when
unlooked-for mercies are bestowed.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>So it was with the
poor cripple. As Marion cautiously conveyed to her the opinion of Dr. Moore
that her suffering might be relieved, and in time perhaps she might be restored
to active life and its duties, the quick gasp, the tightened clasp of her
emaciated hands, the moistened eye raised in silent gratitude to God, were the
only tokens of the fervent thankfulness which almost overcame her.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>When Marion had
explained the doctor's view of her case, she went on: &quot;You must give your
pastor the credit of the plan. He was just sending a telegram to the Home when
I met him at the station, and—and&quot;—she hesitated, surprised at herself for
her reluctance to talk of Mr. Angus—&quot;he offered to bear all the expense of
having you conveyed to New York. But I speedily convinced him that I had the first
claim to that privilege.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;How good God is,
raising up friends for me on every side!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Good by, Mary,
for the present. I shall expect to see you very soon in one of the nice beds at
the Home for the Sick.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>THE family were all
seated at the tea-table when Mr. Angus came in from the street. He apologized
for being behind time by saying that a parishioner had sent for him, and it was
a longer walk than he expected. His countenance bore marks of excitement, but
he entered into conversation with the others, and seemed desirous of averting attention
from himself.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>After family prayer,

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;My Marion is
going to sing a hymn before I go to bed. Please stay and hear it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion had already
commenced, and, without noticing who was near her, went through the hymn.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;We give thee but
thine own,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Whate'er the gift may
be,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>All that we have is
Thine alone,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>A trust, O Lord, from
Thee.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;May we Thy
bounties thus</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>As stewards true
receive.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And gladly as Thou
blessest us,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>To Thee our
first-fruits give.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh hearts are
bruised and dead,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And homes are bare and
cold,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And lambs for whom the
Shepherd bled</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Are straying from the
fold!</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;To comfort and
to bless,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>To find a balm for
woe,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>To tend the lone and
fatherless,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Is angels' work below.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;The captive to
release,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>To God the lost to
bring,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>To teach the way of
life and peace,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It is a Christ-like
thing.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;And we believe
Thy word,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Though dim our faith
may be,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Whate'er for Thine we
do, O Lord,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>We do it unto
Thee.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I propose an
amendment, as the congressmen say,&quot; she urged, pleasantly, as she saw Mr.
Angus. &quot;Please stay and sing with us, and then I have some pleasant news
for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He joined her
instantly at the piano, though she saw that he did so reluctantly. She turned
to the all-inspiring words,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;All hail the
power of Jesus' name!</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Let angels prostrate
fall.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>From the tones of his
voice, as one verse followed another, she could detect the change in his feelings.
In the last stanza it was evident his religious fervor had triumphed over his
sadness. The tones, rich and clear, thrilled Marion's heart strangely.
Happening to meet his eye as she was closing the book, she saw there evidence
of an elevation of soul, as though the sentiments of the hymn had roused him
from his gloom.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Thank you,&quot;
was his low response.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I expect to
leave early in the morning,&quot; she said. &quot;I shall go immediately to see
Dr. B———. Dr. Moore is very hopeful in regard to Mary's cure, though she may
always walk lame. She was very grateful that you had thought of sending her to
the Home for the Sick.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I am delighted,
Miss Howard. You have indeed been an angel of mercy to the poor girl. She
speaks of your thoughtful kindness as one of the chief blessings of her
life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Isn't it
fortunate that Dr. Moore was once house physician there? and he will convey her
to the city himself. No, Mr. Angus,&quot; as he held out his purse, &quot;we
cannot permit you to have all the pleasure, though we gladly share with you.
You have done your part in suggesting the possibility of her restoration, and
she has a friend who will defray all expenses.  By the way, if you can spare
the time, she would be glad of a call from you before she leaves home.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Duties never
conflict, Miss Howard. If you were not so busy among your pupils, etc., I would
express a wish that you would visit a distressed family I saw to-day. They are
in deep waters, and need a kind friend of their own sex.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Who are
they?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Mother, daughter,
and grandson,—one of the most beautiful boys I ever saw. The mother is ill, I
fear on the verge of consumption. The daughter, whom I conclude is a widow, is
too young and beautiful to be left to make her own way in the world. The boy,
Eugene, won my heart at once, and under a sudden impulse I asked the mother to
give him to me: I am fond of children.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I can easily
believe that,&quot; she said, with one of her smiles, which always made his
heart so warm. &quot;If I were not very good-natured I should reproach you with
winning away Ethel's love from me. Isn't she a darling?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>For answer he bent
down and pressed a kiss on the warm, red lips held up so temptingly to his. The
child at this minute had come into the room to bid him and Marion good night;
having done so, she danced away again, hugging Frances, her favorite dolly, in
her arms.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Of such is the
kingdom of heaven,'&quot; murmured the pastor, his eye following her fairy-like
figure; &quot;and we are told that unless we are like them, we cannot be admitted
to that glorious home.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>After a pause he
added, &quot;Eugene interested me deeply, but not at all in the way Ethel does.
He is as full of mischief as he can hold; nothing ethereal about him. He is
earthly even in his beauty, while Ethel seems just fresh from heaven. Dear
child! I have learned many a lesson from her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You have
interested me deeply in your friends, Mr. Angus. I wish now I could stay
another day at least, but I cannot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Recalling the business
which sent her home so soon, there was an earnestness in her voice, as she
repeated, &quot;Oh, no, I cannot stay!&quot; that rather surprised her hearer.
Meeting the questioning glance, it was as much as the impulsive girl could do
to check herself from saying,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I go for your
sake, to give you that which will restore peace to your heart.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;But I hope to be
so successful in my business that I can come again soon. I will ask Aunt Asbury
to visit them, if you wish.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It is not a case
of poverty,—at least I think not. The mother—she seems very young—needs sympathy
and counsel; she would only take it from one she loved.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He seemed to be urging
a duty upon her, though he did not so intend it; and Marion grew excited,
wondering whether she ought to write Dr. B— about Mary, and postpone her other
business for another day.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I wish I knew
which was my duty: I have set my heart on something. I ought not to have
delayed it so long. I have been forgetful of a sacred charge, and I wish to
atone for it as soon as possible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She gazed wistfully in
his face, longing to give him a ray of the hope she felt almost sure was in
store for him,—almost, not quite. &quot;If, after all, I am wrong, and he is
not the one, it would be inexcusable in me to excite hopes only to crush
them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Miss
Howard,&quot; he began, unable to endure the sight of her distress, which by
turns suffused her cheeks and blanched them, &quot;can you not trust me to
decide for you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;In almost any
other case but this, I could. It would be cruel to tell you now.&quot; She
stood one moment, her hands tightly clasped, her eyes fixed on the carpet;
then, with a sudden change, she looked smiling in his face as she said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Give me the
exact direction to your protégé's, and I'll go to-morrow morning. I can write
this evening to Dr. B—.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Uncle
Asbury,&quot; inquired Marion later in the evening, and when no one but her
uncle and aunt were present, &quot;have you ever mentioned before Mr. Angus
that I have any other income than what I earn from teaching?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Not a word. He
considers you suffering from extreme poverty, and quite worries himself over
the time you lose during your visits to us. If you press me to tell you the
whole truth, he is anxious lest your love for dress and jewels should involve
you in serious pecuniary embarrassment. He considers that rich silk and
point-lace collar, though extremely becoming, quite beyond your means.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Nonsense! Now do
be serious. I don't want anybody to know, and especially strangers like Mr.
Angus, that—&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You can, if you
choose buy up half our congregation, to say nothing of the poor minister.  No,
I won't tell him that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Don't tease the
child, pa,&quot; put in Mrs. Asbury, though laughing herself.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It is from the
clergyman especially you wish this important information kept,&quot; questioned
the gentleman, his eye twinkling.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion looked really
annoyed. &quot;I see I must explain,&quot; she began. &quot;There are some poor
people I am going to help. He offered, from his salary, I suppose, to pay
Mary's expenses to the city, etc. I told him a friend would supply the means,
and I don't wish him to think I am the one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;On the principle
of the left hand hiding from the right, I suppose. Yes, I see.&quot; With a
mischievous glance, he turned to his newspaper, and Marion, informing her aunt
that she intended to make a call on a sick lady in the morning, and had postponed
her return till afternoon, bade them good-night and retired to her chamber.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Passing Ethel's room,
she found to her surprise that the child was still awake.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Please come in a
minute, Marion: I must get up again. I can't remember whether I have said my
prayers. I feel prayers in here,&quot; putting her hand to her breast,
&quot;and I can't go to sleep.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Well, darling,
get up, and I'll kneel with you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Ethel began with—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Now I lay me
down to sleep,&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>followed with the
Lord's Prayer, then began her own simple petitions.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Bless me, dear
God, and make me as good as Jesus wants me to be. Bless papa and mamma and Mr.
Angus, and all those I love, and keep them all from sin and from crying. I
thank you for giving me such a kind papa and mamma. I thank you for sparing
them to me so long. I hope you will spare them as long as you think it is safe,
but if you don't think it safe to-morrow or next day, thy will be done.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The little head was
scarcely on the pillow, when Marion, much amused by the child's mode of expressing
her submission, ran back to the parlor to repeat it. As she entered she heard
Mr. Angus's voice asking permission to use the buggy at an early hour to go to
a distant part of the town. Seeing her, he explained that, as she had been kind
enough to delay her return to New York in order to visit this distressed
family, he wished to make arrangements to take her there.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It is in a part
of the town with which I am least familiar,&quot; he added, &quot;and I should
find difficult to direct any one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I am
sorry,&quot; said Marion, frankly.  &quot;I know your rule about your morning
hours for study.  I would delay my return longer, but it is impossible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And it had seemed
impossible ever since she had agreed to make the morning visit to his protégés.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;If he only
knew,&quot; she said to herself again and again, &quot;how much depends on my
going home. I am confident that package is somewhere among my papers; and yet
it is so strange that I have not seen it for years. I had forgotten entirely
that I had it in possession. I did sympathize deeply with that poor, friendless
girl, an orphan, as I had so lately become; but, with so many different
protégés on hand,—so many orphans and others whom I have taken to that blessed
Home,—she had passed entirely out of mind, until that peculiar smile of Mr.
Angus and the expressive shrug of his shoulders brought her up before me. Let
me think. When I left Uncle Williamson's, my letters, papers, etc., were all
packed up and sent to my present home. Strange I haven't seen them. No, some
were sent here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She gave a scream of
joy, and, running to the kitchen for a hand-lamp, called a servant to go with
her to the attic, where a box marked with her name was stored.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>At the breakfast-table,
when Mrs. Asbury remonstrated against her niece's plans, while she looked so
pale and haggard, no one present, and least of all the pastor, suspected that
it was interest in his future which had kept her till midnight searching among
her papers for what she could not find, that disappointment and bitter regret that
she had not more carefully guarded so sacred a trust had caused her many tears.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>To add to her
embarrassment, Mr. Asbury, just as he rose from the table, approached her and
said, &quot;Marion, I fear it is your pecuniary situation which troubles you.
Promise me that you will apply to me in any need.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Why, pa!&quot;
began Annie in surprise; but she never finished her sentence. Marion, noticing
that Mr. Angus was within hearing, gave her cousin a warning glance, coolly
said to her uncle, &quot;I promise,&quot; and then walked away.</span></p>

<h1><a id="Part_1_Chapter_11"><span class='c8'>CHAPTER XI.</span></a></h1>

<h1><span class='c6'>AN APPEAL FOR SYMPATHY.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>THE family to whom Mr.
Angus wished to introduce Miss Howard lived in a small cottage in the outskirts
of the town of N-.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>On their way thither
he repeated the impression they had made upon him,—that they had seen better
days.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I have been
enough among the poor in New York,&quot; he said, warming, with the subject,
&quot;to be sure that these are not of the kind who would ask for assistance,
even though they were suffering. I am eager to know how they will impress
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He turned to look in
her face, which seemed to be unusually thoughtful, but with a bright smile, she
explained,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I was trying to
reconcile irreconcilable facts. For instance, I know a gentleman in New York
who has more leisure and money than he knows what to do with, and I was
wondering why I should be so very busy and have so little time for work that I
like best.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I have solved
worse puzzles than that, Miss Howard. Can you not imbue your friend with love
for your favorite work? Gentlemen with too much leisure are not to be classed
with the most favored beings.&quot; </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;He is one of the
most wretched men I know, sarcastic and cynical to such a degree that his
society is shunned by every one; and yet I can't help pitying him. I believe
that he has a passion for making himself appear worse than he is. I have taken
a fancy,&quot; she added, with a hearty laugh, &quot;to try some experiments on
him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Of what
nature?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Why, I have been
told again and again that he has no heart. I am applying tests to find out the
fact for myself; so far, that important organ seems to be in a state of
ossification; but I am not discouraged.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;If I were your
uncle, I should warn you that ossified hearts, when wakened from their torpor,
sometimes become dangerously active,—I mean dangerous for their own happiness.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion's eyes twinkled
with mirth. &quot;I do not fear too much activity, I fear too little. But is
not that the house?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Angus had told her
the child was beautiful; but this had by no means prepared her for the lovely,
enchanting face which burst upon her as, advancing into the room, a boy of
three or four years sprang out from an inner apartment.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh, you darling
little fellow!&quot; she cried, catching him in her arms, and bestowing kiss
after kiss upon him. So absorbed was Marion in delight and wonder that she did
not notice the entrance of a young lady from a door in the opposite direction,
until the voice of Mr. Angus saying, &quot;Miss Howard, Mrs. Cheriton,&quot;
roused her to present realities.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Excuse me,&quot;
she began, cheeks and chin dimpling with amusement. &quot;I forgot that I was a
stranger,—everything in my admiration for—.&quot; She interrupted herself to
place the child on the floor; but he had no idea of being abandoned so
suddenly. He clung tightly around her neck, his face sparkling with mischief.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Genie, don't
tease the lady.&quot; The mother's voice was soft, and she spoke with a pretty
accent; but the boy paid not the slightest attention to his mother's mild
suggestion. He clung to his new friend, occasionally holding himself off far
enough to look in her face.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Catching a glimpse of
Mr. Angus's tall form standing over near the door, his hat in his hand, keen
appreciation of the scene stamped on every feature, Marion's color surged to
her very brow. She whispered, &quot;Go to the gentleman now, Genie,&quot; and
put the boy to the floor.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Will you take a
drive with me, Eugene?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>This being soon
arranged, Mr. Angus carried the child to the buggy, merely saying to Marion,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I will be back
in half an hour.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mrs. Cheriton looked
so very youthful that it was hard for Marion to believe she could be the mother
of Eugene. She was very beautiful, of the Southern type of beauty,—large,
liquid eyes, regular features, abundant tresses of blue-black hair, which on
the present occasion were wound gracefully around her head, arched eyebrows, and
a pleasant smile when she addressed you. This tout ensemble the visitor took in
at a glance, and all the time she was asking herself, &quot;Shall I like
her?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>After speaking for a
moment of Eugene, Marion said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Mr. Angus tells
me your mother is very ill.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes; and she has
heard your voice. Will you go to her?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Gladly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>On the bed, but raised
almost to a sitting posture, lay a lady. One glance proved her to be such.
There was an air of refinement and culture about her which proved her to belong
to the best-educated class of society.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She met Marion's
sympathetic glance with an earnest gaze, as though she would read what manner
of spirit she was of; then a beaming smile lighted her whole face, as she said
softly,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You are very
welcome, my dear.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I felt
then,&quot; said Marion afterwards to her aunt, &quot;as though I could take
her right into my heart of hearts.&quot; What she did at the moment to show
what she felt was to bend over and press her lips to the pale cheek of the
sufferer.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>A few words of
explanation as to her present visit,—of sorrow that it must be a hurried
one,—and then Marion said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I am sure you
will not consider my question prompted by curiosity, if I ask, why are you here
in this out-of-the-way part of the town?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Necessity
compels it, my dear. I need perfect quiet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Would you prefer
the city?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Greatly, in many
respects, if I were well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You could have a
physician near you there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;No physician can
avail me now,—at least such is my belief.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Except the great
Physician.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>An expression of
heavenly peace stole over the wan face. She held Marion's hand in a closer
grasp, as she said fervently,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;God be praised!
He has applied healing balm. My sins, which were many, are forgiven. Oh, if you
knew all, you would not wonder that I look forward with longing to the hour
when he will call me home!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You would feel
like a poor sailor I found just redeemed from the very depths of woe. He was
singing from morning to night,&quot;—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Love I much, I'm much
forgiven; I'm a miracle of grace.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion's clear voice
as she sang the lines rang through the room.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Will you sing a
hymn for me, Miss Howard?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Without a moment's
hesitation the young began one which was a favorite with herself.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Whate'er my God
ordains is right;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>His will is ever just;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Howe'er he orders now
my cause,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>I will be still and

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He is my God:</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Though dark my road,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He holds me that I shall
not fall,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Wherefore to him I
leave it all.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Whate'er my God
ordains is right;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He never will deceive.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He leads me by the
proper path,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And so to him I
cleave,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And take content</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>What he hath sen</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>His hand can turn my
griefs away,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And patiently I wait his
day.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Whate'er my God
ordains is right;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Though I the cup must
drink,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>That bitter seems to
my faint heart,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>I will not fear nor
shrink.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Tears pass away</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>With dawn of day;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Sweet comfort yet
shall fill my heart,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And pain and sorrow
all depart.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Whate'er my God
ordains is right;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>My Light, my Life is
he,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Who cannot will me
aught but good,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>I trust him utterly;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>For well I know,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In joy or woe,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>We soon shall see, as
sunlight clear,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>How faithful was our
Guardian here.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Whate'er my God
ordains is right;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Here will I take my
stand,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Though sorrow, need,
or death make earth</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>For me a desert land.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>My Father's care</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Is round me there;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He holds me, that I
shall not fall,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And so to him I leave
it all.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Before she had ended,
the door softly opened and was left ajar.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion started at the
sound of wheels. &quot;There is Mr. Angus!&quot; she exclaimed; &quot;but I
cannot go yet. I feel as though I had known you all my life. I have to go to
New York to-day. I want you to go to the city. Why will you not come to me? I
have room for all of you. Yes, that will be best. It will be next to having my
mother with me. I can insure you a quiet room. Will you come?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mrs. Douglas closed
her eyes; tears called forth by such kindness from a stranger, trickled through
the eyelids. Striving for self-control she said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Mr. Angus told
me you were an angel of mercy. Never did any strangers in a strange land need
friends more than we do. I have prayed night and day that my heavenly Father
would raise up for my poor Juliette and Eugene Christian friends. He has
answered my prayers. I will consider your proposal to go to New York, where
board within our means can perhaps be obtained near you. For Juliette's sake I
would be glad to be there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I regret so much
that business of importance calls me home to-day, but I will find a place at
once, if you will not accept my invitation. I am sure I can promise for Mr.
Angus that he will be a good friend to you and attend to your removal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Mamma, I'm going
home with Mr. Angus,&quot; shouted Genie, bursting into the outer room.
&quot;I'm tired of staying here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Miss
Howard,&quot;—the voice was so full of solemnity that Marion bent over the bed
again to listen, her breath coming quickly,—&quot;you do not seem like a
stranger. Mr. Angus told me I might confide in you. If I had time and strength
I would tell you the sad story of my past life. I was gay and thoughtless,
living for this world alone. I have been justly punished. Some time, if God
gives me strength, I would like to tell you my sad story. If, after you know
all, you are willing to be a friend to the dear ones I leave behind, the only burden
left me will be removed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I will gladly
listen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>With moistened eyes
she had just answered, when Mrs. Cheriton opened the bedroom door, saying,
&quot;Your husband has returned, madam, and asks whether you are ready.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion bent over the
bed and kissed the sick lady, glad to hide her blushing cheeks caused by Mrs.
Cheriton's blunder. Then saying,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Please explain
that Mr. Angus is only my friend. I shall see you again before long,&quot; hastened
to the door.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Eugene was still in
the arms of the clergyman and it required much persuasion on the part of his
mother to coax him to remain with her.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<h1><a id="Part_1_Chapter_12"><span class='c8'>CHAPTER XII.</span></a></h1>

<h1><span class='c6'>MARION'S SICKNESS.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>THE drive back to town
was a silent one, and not until they were within a short distance from home was
a word spoken. Mr. Angus seemed absorbed in thought, and his companion, with
the added care of the friends she had just left, was little inclined for
conversation. A sigh from her at last caused the gentleman to ask,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Have I done
wrong in bringing to your notice these strangers?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;No, sir. No,
indeed. What a dear old lady she is! And not very old either. Sorrow, I
imagine, more than time, has aged her. Eugene is a perfect dream of boyish
beauty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What of the
young mother?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion sighed again.
&quot;I don't know.  I have been trying to decide. I have seen somebody whom
she resembles. She does not attract me as her mother does.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Eugene scarcely
has a feature like hers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;No, he is more
like you than like her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She had entirely
forgotten her high praise of the boy's beauty; but a little twitching about the
muscles of his mouth proved that he remembered and was far from displeased.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Do you
know,&quot; she asked quickly, as they drew up to the door of her uncle's
house, &quot;that I am going to take your new parishioners to New York? For
some reason, Madam Douglass prefers being there, and I have promised for you
that you will aid them in their removal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Pecuniarily, do
you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Certainly not.
Only as a friend, in getting to the right train, etc.;  but even that is not
necessary: Uncle Asbury will attend to it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Just as you
please, Miss Howard.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She sprang from the
carriage without giving him an opportunity to help her, and ran into the house.
His voice, so sad and cold, had hurt her. Seeing no one in the hall, she went
in haste to her own room, to pack her satchel for her journey home, saying to
herself meanwhile,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;If he knew all
that I do, and all that I can guess about his sad past, and how shamefully I
have neglected my promise to that poor, dying girl, he would be justified in
never speaking to me at all.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>At the dinner-table
Marion gave a description of Madam Douglass and Eugene, merely mentioning Mrs.
Cheriton as the boy's mother; and easily won a promise from her aunt to go and
see them. &quot;I wish, aunty,&quot; she added, after the conversation had
turned to another subject, &quot;that you would notice whether Mrs. Cheriton
resembles any one you know. Her eyes haunt me. I have tried in vain to account for
the resemblance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Once on the train,
Marion acknowledged to herself the need of rest. With one hand to her throbbing
temples, she took memorandum book and pencil from her pocket. Two visits to
some very destitute families ought to be paid, and Hepsey must take her place
for this time. She noted down the following words: &quot;Board for three, not
too far away. Home for the Sick. Letter to Dr. Moore. Search for lost package.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The carriage, with
James on the box with the driver, met her at the station, as she had
telegraphed him to do. Seizing a letter from Dr. B-, she read hastily, and,
finding that Mary could be received at once on the recommendation of Dr. Moore,
countermanded her order to be driven to the hospital, and said
&quot;Home.&quot; Here she only remained long enough to dash off a letter to
Dr. Moore, enclosing the one from the superintendent, and then went to Mrs.
Mitchell for advice about a boarding-place. Four or five were advertised as
desirable situations; and Marion, putting by her anxiety to begin her search
for the package, hurried off in the carriage to examine for herself. Two or three
hours were consumed in going from one house to another, finding each that she
visited more unsuitable than the one before it, and at last only engaged rooms
conditionally, in a private family, recommended to her by a friend, whom she
met near the door. Enclosing the street and number to her aunt, she requested
that Madam Douglass might be informed of the place and price, and an answer
returned at once.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Hepsey was just about
starting on her mission when she caught a glimpse of her young mistress, and
exclaimed, in great excitement,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You are ill, and
have not told me. I must see you in bed before I go out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It was indeed true
that a terrible lassitude had been stealing over her ever since the excitement
of the morning. For two nights she had scarcely slept, and since breakfast she
had barely tasted food.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;A cup of tea
will revive me,&quot; she said, trying with a smile to allay Hepsey's too
evident anxiety.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Then feeling herself
grow more languid, she said, aloud,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I can't give up
now. I must find that package, I must, if I search all night.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The tea was brought
and eagerly swallowed, but the temples still throbbed, and at last the young
girl reluctantly acknowledged that she felt ill and must rest for a few hours.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Hepsey quietly laid
off her bonnet and shawl, called James, and gave him the address of the poor
she was going to visit, with directions as to procuring them food, etc., and
then devoted herself to her young mistress.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>An hour later Marion
woke from the heavy sleep into which she had fallen with a shriek of distress.
Her eyes were wide open, but she did not recognize the faithful nurse who was
bending over her. A physician was instantly summoned, who found her in a high
state of mental excitement.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;How long has
this been coming on? I ought to have been called earlier,&quot; he said, in
some irritation.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;She only returned from
the country this afternoon,&quot; explained Hepsey.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He went back to the bedside,
re-examined the pulse of his patient, listened to her incoherent mutterings,
and then said gravely, &quot;She has symptoms of a contagious fever. I have had
a few cases already among the poor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;James has just
returned from an errand to one of her protégés, a mission boy. He had just been
buried, and a flag was hung from the window to prevent people from
entering.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Well, if people
will go round to these filthy haunts, they,—but it's no use to think of that
now. I'll do my best to save her. I'll have a flag out here, unless you will
promise that no one shall come in: perfect quiet is a necessity.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Hepsey promised, but
the next morning, after a short absence from the room, she found a young lady
sitting by the bed, bathing the hot temples of the sufferer.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I have come to
stay,&quot; she said softly, as she rose and beckoned Hepsey into the hall.
&quot;Mrs. Mitchell told me last night how ill she is, and I have come prepared
to act as nurse. You will let me help you&quot;; and the young girl gazed
wistfully in Hepsey's face.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It was Annie Leman, a
favorite protégé of Marion, whom she was educating for a music teacher, and,
looking in her earnest face, Hepsey had not the heart to deny her request.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;We'll see what
the doctor will say,&quot; she murmured, and then they both returned to the
room.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>What the doctor said
at first sight of this girlish figure was, &quot;I won't have her here.&quot;
What he said after the second day was, &quot;What could we do without
her?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And so the sun rose
and set while in that quiet room the fever raged, for Marion had been in the
full vigor of health, and the heated blood rushed rampant through her body.
Sometimes she tried to spring from the bed, calling out,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I must find
it,&quot; or &quot;Here it is,&quot; and laughed aloud for joy. At other times
she lay for hours in a heavy stupor, while rich and poor besieged the door with
inquiries concerning her.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Among others who came
was Dr. Moore. He had safely conveyed Mary Falkner to the Home for the Sick,
where he learned from Dr. B— that Miss Howard was dangerously ill, and went at
once to her house to learn who was her physician, when they came together to
see her.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion woke suddenly,
to find her old friend from N— bending over her. A momentary consciousness
caused her to call him by name, and then, associating him at once with her
friends in Grantbury, she said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Tell him there
is hope,&quot; then fell back into heavy sleep. Every morning came a bunch of
cut flowers of the choicest varieties from Mr. Lambert, with a request to Mrs.
Mitchell to be informed whether &quot;any change had taken place in Miss
Howard.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Day after day as it
passed proved to all Marion's friends that the young girl who glided so
noiselessly around the bed was possessed of a native skill just fitting her to
take a part in the struggle between life and death going on in that chamber.
She was never seen to sleep, and yet she never seemed weary. Not a movement of
that prone figure escaped her notice, not an order or prescription of the physician
was forgotten. When the doctor asked in wonder,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What sustains
you?&quot; her brief answer was, &quot;Love, sir. Love and gratitude. She
deserves from me all that I can give her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Hepsey told Mrs.
Asbury, who came from Grantbury to see her niece,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;We have all
cause to thank God for sending Miss Annie here. The doctor says, if our dear
Marion lives through this dreadful time, it will be the loving care, which,
with the blessing of God, has brought her through.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>If Mr. Lambert
believed what he was so fond of affirming, that the poor are a thankless set,
who will steal your purse the minute your back is turned, his faith in this
assurance might have been shaken by the genuine sorrow manifested during Miss
Howard's illness.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>One instance of
affection and gratitude he was himself a witness of. He was approaching Miss
Howard's door early one morning with a bunch of exquisite blossoms in his hand,
carefully shielded from sun and wind by the tissue paper covering, when he saw
a little girl approaching from the opposite direction. She had on a thin shawl,
which she held out from her person as though shielding something precious.
Curiosity prompted the gentleman to watch and see what she was going to do. He
held back till she ran down the basement steps and timidly rang the bell of the
lower door of Mr. Mitchell's house.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Cautiously he stepped
forward, and saw her hold out one little pink.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Will you please
give the kind lady this?&quot; she asked, in a pleading tone. &quot;When I was
down with fever, she brought me a beautiful bush all covered with flowers, and
she told me how to water it, and put it in the sun. This flower came out last
night. There are no more, or I would have brought them. She's been ever so good
to mammy and me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>There were tears in
her voice as she spoke, and the listener, grumbling under his breath at his own
folly, put up his finger to prevent a tear from falling from his own eye.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What's your
name?&quot; asked the woman at the door.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Nanny
Morse,—she'll know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Well, I'll see
that she has it,—if it's only to hold in her poor, unconscious fingers,&quot;
she added, as the child, after an earnest &quot;Thank you, ma'am,&quot; turned
away.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Lambert afterwards
confessed that he felt like throwing his costly flowers into the street. He did
not, however; he rang the bell, delivered them to James, the servant in
waiting, received the sadly spoken message, &quot;No change, sir,&quot; and
then hurried away, muttering,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;World upside
down; just my luck; only girl in all the crowd worth that,&quot; snapping his
finger; &quot;and she going—&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He stopped suddenly at
sight of the little flower-girl again.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She was talking to a
disreputably dressed lad, who, with a rimless cap stuck on one side of his
head, was evidently annoyed at the detention.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Don't go, Jack.
'T would grieve her, even in heaven, if she knew you'd turn back to the bad
after all she's done for yer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'm hungry, and
if I go home mammy'll beat me, sure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;No, she won't,
Jack,—not when I tell her about the kind lady. Come, go with me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Take this and
buy a cake,&quot; exclaimed Mr. Lambert, thrusting some silver pieces into
Nanny's hand.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Not waiting for any
thanks, he strode off in the opposite direction, muttering, &quot;Old fool!
Just like you! Meddling, always meddling.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>After using his
handkerchief vigorously, he went on: &quot;What business is it of mine, if she
dies to-day? I don't care. Yes, that's a lie: you do care, you old sinner! You
only say that because you're so hateful,—you know you care. You'll never see
another like her. There!&quot;</span></p>

<h1><a id="Part_1_Chapter_13"><span class='c8'>CHAPTER XIII.</span></a></h1>

<h1><span class='c6'>ANNIE'S LETTER.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>THE third week of
Marion's sickness there came a crisis and hope. Yes, it was evident to all
there was hope now, where fear had prevailed. The doctor's mouth, which had
been so firm and rigid, relaxed; and there was a suspicion of a smile. 
Hepsey's eyes were less watery, James opened and shut the outer door in a
jubilant manner, proud of being the one to say to the anxious inquirers,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;The doctor
begins to hope.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>On Annie Leman's pale
face had come beams of light, which made her beautiful. Scarcely conscious of
her own action, she went forward to the physician, caught his hand and pressed
it in both hers.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;How can I thank
you sir,&quot; she said, softly.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Pshaw, Miss
Annie! She owes more to you than to me. We can both thank God. She has been so
close to the open gates, I think she can tell us something of what is
inside.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>One Thursday morning,
twenty-six days from the time she left Grantbury, Marion opened her eyes and
the light of consciousness dawned in them.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>For one instant there
was a bewildered expression as she gazed at her faithful watcher, who sat by
her side; then she smiled, and said faintly,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It's
Annie.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, dear.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;How came I in
bed? I remember I felt ill in the cars.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You have been
sick, but you are much better now. Take a spoonful of this, dear, and go to
sleep again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Lie down by me,
Annie, and I'll try to sleep. You look pale and tired.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Annie smoothed the
pillow, changed Marion's position, and then lay down on the outside of the bed,
as she had done so many times during the last weary weeks.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Miss Howard's
excellent constitution is doing wonders for her,&quot; remarked Dr. Ross, as,
after the crisis, she seemed to make a leap into the arms of health. &quot;No
more drugs: Nature will do her own work now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>This was Marion's
first experience of severe illness, and it was difficult to make her understand
that for a time she must be economical of her newly gained energies.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I feel so
strong,&quot; she insisted, &quot;that I ought to be waiting on Annie, instead
of her waiting on me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Speaking of Miss
Annie,&quot; said the doctor, &quot;I have two little girls old enough to learn
music. By-and-by, when you are well, I shall ask her to take them into her
care.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;How do you know
she is competent, Doctor? You ought to consult me,&quot; urged Marion, with her
old beaming smile, as she saw that her favorite pupil had difficulty in
controlling her gratitude at this unexpected offer. </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'll test her
capabilities now.  Come, Miss Annie, into the parlor, and give me a piece
offhand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>With many blushes she
obeyed, and, seating herself at the piano, played from memory an accompaniment
to a simple ballad, which she sang with so much sweetness that the physician
was delighted.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Teach my girls
to play and sing like that,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;and your fortune is made.
Teach them another accomplishment, too,—to play when they are asked, without
excuses, as you did. I more than half expected you would say, 'I'm all out of
practice, Doctor'; or, 'I'm far from strong.' Teach them all that, and you'll
win the gratitude of one father.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Before Marion was able
to drive out herself, she insisted that Annie should spend several hours every
day in the open air. Indeed, she contrived so many errands which it was
imperative must be attended to immediately that the young girl could not
refuse.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She early learned that
Mary Falkner came to the city soon after the place in the Home for the Sick had
been secured for her, that Dr. Moore had seen her safely in the bed in her
ward, and had afterward had a consultation visit on her own case with Dr. Ross.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She seemed to have
forgotten all about her new protégés, Mrs. Douglass and Mrs. Cheriton; but one
day, on looking over the cards left during her sickness, she found one which
brought the crimson tide back to her pale cheeks.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It was a card with the
name in print,—Harold Angus; and underneath, in a fine hand, was written Juliette
Cheriton, with the street and number of her boarding-place.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh, how much I
have to do!&quot; Marion said. &quot;I forgot this lady entirely.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Annie wondered what
caused the pained voice and firmly set lips of her friend, but she only said
soothingly,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Don't worry,
dear. Tell me if there is any thing I can do to help you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion put her hand
wearily to her head, and in answer to Annie's earnest remonstrance, pleading
that she would think of nothing about business now, she only asked,—&quot;How
soon will the doctor be here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Not for some
hours yet. You will have time for a good nap.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Please give me
my pen and paper: I must write a few words, then I will try to rest; and, Annie
dear, will you leave me alone a few minutes?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The table was drawn
nearer, materials for writing placed within reach, and Annie, after a wistful
glance at her friend, left the chamber. If she could have looked back and seen
the weary, tired, pained expression which came over her friend's face as she
seized the pen, she might have doubted whether she was acting wisely to leave her.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The note was quickly
written, indeed the words were dashed off with a fierce energy, as though she
doubted her ability to finish, unless at once. It read thus:—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'> </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Mr. Harold Angus:—</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Life is uncertain.
I hope to live to restore to you a packet from one</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>whom I strongly
suspect was dear to you. To find this package drove</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>me home from
Grantbury, where I first heard that which connected you</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>in my thoughts with
a young girl called Stella. I am not aware of its</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>contents, and can
only say now that Stella died of consumption at the</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Home for the Sick,
loving and forgiving and blessing all those who</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>had been dear to
her.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>MARION HOWARD.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Having sealed this,
and written the address, she added this direction: &quot;If I should die,
please deliver this at once;&quot; then, enclosing the whole in a blank
envelope, she touched her hand-bell and requested Annie to place it in her
desk.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I must rest my
head now,&quot; she said; &quot;but first, I want you to promise me that, in case
anything should happen to me, you will forward any letters you may find in my
desk.  Don't look so frightened, dear. I shall try to get well, for I have a
great deal to do, and life is so pleasant; but there are duties which I dared not
defer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>At this moment James
knocked at the door, and passed in a letter just delivered by the postman.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It is Annie
Asbury's handwriting,&quot; explained Marion, in a glad voice.  &quot;It will
soothe me to sleep, perhaps. Annie is a dear child.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The letter read thus:-</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>DEAR MARION,—</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Imagine me sitting
by the east window, where I can</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>look out on the
great elm-tree, and hear the robin-redbreasts as they</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>are calling their
mates to join them in a morning song. I wish you</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>could see the
grass. It looks greener than green, now that the sun</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>is touching it. I guess somebody else is feasting his eyes on the</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>emerald greensward
(that's quoted), for I hear a curtain rolled up</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>and window-sash
raised, so I am going to quit this highfalutin style,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>and let my pen run
on as it will; but, before I forget it, I must</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>tell you that ever
since Mr. Angus ran up to town the day he called</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>to inquire for you
there has been a change in him. Before that he had</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>one of his worst
attacks of depression, or dyspepsia, as Aunt</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Thankful calls
them; but now he seems to have made up his mind not</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>I can explain what

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>understand. Last
night, after prayers, ma must have noticed something</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>different in him,
for she went to him and held out her hand in that</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>kind way of hers.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;I thank you
for your prayer,&quot; she said: &quot;it has done me good.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>All the answer he
made was to repeat these words,—</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;God is my
refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>As he stood with
his eyes fixed full on hers, I saw a new light</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>in them, as though
he had said to himself, &quot;I'm going to take courage</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>and go ahead.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>If he had seen you,
and you had talked to him as you did to pa and ma</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>after dear Helen
died, I should have expected to see just such a</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>look.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>I suppose you know,
dear, that those foreign people went away the</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>week after you did.
Ma went with Mr. Angus and brought Eugene here.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>He is so beautiful
he almost took my breath away; but I am sorry</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>to say he is so far
from good in Ethel's meaning of the word that she</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>considers it
necessary to pray for him very often. Not a soul would</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>he obey but Mr.
Angus. I laughed so much I had to go out of the room:</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>there was that boy
with eyes flashing, defying everybody to make him</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>stop teasing the
cat, and holding her up by the tail; and there was</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Ethel perfectly
dumb with astonishment, eyes wide open, pale cheeks,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>and that little
quiver of her lips she has when grieved. Mr. Angus</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>took in the
situation at once and said,—</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;Come to me,
Eugene.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>The boy did not
stir.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>If I were an artist
I would try to sketch Mr. Angus's eyes, as he</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>fixed them on the
defiant little fellow. There was power in them.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>I think Ethel would
be frightened into fits if he looked at her in</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>that way. Eugene
endured it a minute and then ran, throwing his arms</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>around the neck of
the conqueror, who looked lovingly enough then.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>I only waited to
see whether Ethel would be jealous; but the precious</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>child went up and
held up her sweet lips to kiss Eugene and show him</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>she forgave him;
then I ran to my room and had a hearty laugh all to</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>myself.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Mr. Angus told ma
that Eugene was a Spanish Creole, and that it is</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>natural for him to
be hot-blooded.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Ma said you wanted
me to write a whole letter about Ethel,—all her</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>funny sayings and
doings. I'm sorry now I didn't begin with these,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>for I fear my
letter will be too long.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>First, she is a
darling.  Yesterday she came running in from the</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>garden, her hair
all in a friz about her forehead, her cheeks of a</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>brilliant color.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh, my!&quot;
she cried, throwing off her hat. &quot;I'm all in a</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>sweatperation.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;A what?&quot;
repeated Gardner, trying not to laugh.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;A
sweatperation. Isn't that right?&quot; she asked quickly, as he burst</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>out laughing.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;It's
perspiration, dear,&quot; I explained.  She was a little mortified.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>She has begun to
learn the Commandments, and applies them to herself</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>and her dolls on
all occasions.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Do you remember
that habit she used to have of twirling a piece of</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>her dress or apron
when she was talking? She made a clean dress look</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>so mussed, ma told
her she mustn't do it.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>A few days ago I
heard her talking to her favorite doll, Frances.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;You have been
a very naughty girl: you have broken the Commandments.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Don't deny it,
Frances. I saw you do it.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;What has poor
Frances done?&quot; I asked.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;Mussed her
nice dress all up, so she can't go to the party.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;It wasn't
pretty for her to do it; but I don't think it was breaking</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>the Commandments,
dear.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;Why, yes, it
is, Annie, because I forbid her to do it.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh! it comes
under obedience, then.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, she is
very naughty.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Two weeks ago Mr.
Angus asked ma to let Ethel and I go on the lake</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>with him. Ma is
afraid of the water, you know, and so she asked,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>anxiously,—</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;Are you used
to rowing?&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>He seemed very much
amused as he said, &quot;Yes, Mrs. Asbury.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Pa laughed as he
explained, &quot;Our pastor is a regular sailor, ma:</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>I'll trust
him.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>When we were
getting into the boat I was a little afraid myself,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>it tipped so; and
there stood dear little Ethel shaking from head</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>to foot.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;Will it tip
over?&quot; she asked, as Mr. Angus lifted her carefully in.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;No, dear. I
think God will take care of us.&quot; He looked very lovingly</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>at her as he put
her down on the cross seat in the centre, while I</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>sat at one end and
he at the other. There was not a sign of fear</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>after that. She sat
up straight, looking at him, but not saying a</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>word till he
asked,—</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;Do you like
it, Ethel?&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>The next day she
was in his room, and he saw her take her five</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>dollies out of the
locker and make them all kneel down by her doll's</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>bedstead. She was
just going to kneel too, when he asked,—</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;What are you
doing, Ethel?&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>She came right up
to him and said, &quot;Ma is going to take me to</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>New York when my
Marion is well enough, and I'm going to ask God</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>to make the boat go
softly.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;That's
right,&quot; he told her; and then he heard her whisper a little</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>prayer.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>He told ma that she
seemed perfectly sure after this that the boat</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>would go softly, as
she said. He often says, &quot;She is a blessed</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>child.&quot; He
never praises her, as so many do; but I know he thinks her</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>beautiful, from the
way he spoke one day when a lady was comparing</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>her with another
child. He said, &quot;There can be no comparison.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>For purity and
sweetness of expression, she is beyond any child</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>I ever saw.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>I must tell you one
thing more about our pet, and then I think you</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>will credit me with
four letters of common length.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>You know we have
always wondered that Ethel should remember so much</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>about her nurse
Bridget, who died a year ago. She always seemed</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>troubled about her,
and used to look up and say, &quot;Can't you speak</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>to me out of
heaven? Can't you just whisper a little?&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>A few days ago she
went into the kitchen and sat down very soberly.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;It's very
bad,&quot; she began, &quot;to have naughty legs go into heaven.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Naughty legs had
better be cut off than to try to get into heaven.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Cook told ma, and
we all thought she had heard somebody read about;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;If thy right
hand offend thee,&quot; etc.; but she came to ma the same</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>day, sat down, and
began to sigh.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>She looked
anxiously in ma's face as she said,—</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;I suppose
Bridget has told God by this time that I kicked her.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Ma says she was very
much surprised, as she never knew Ethel to kick</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>any one; but she
answered calmly,—</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;If Bridget
told God, she told him also that you didn't mean to.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;But I did
mean to.&quot; She held her finger up to emphasize it, and</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>repeated, &quot;I
did mean to.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;Well, then,
dear, she told him that you were sorry.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes,&quot;
sighing.  &quot;I'm sorry now. I wasn't sorry then, when she went</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>away.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;I'll tell
you, darling, what you can do,&quot;—ma saw she was really</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>troubled and
conscience-stricken,—&quot;you can kneel down and tell God</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>yourself that you
are sorry. He will forgive you.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>She knelt for some
time by her little chair, whispering her prayer in</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>God's ear. Since
that she has never mentioned Bridget's name.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>She must have
suffered all that time from the pricks of her tender</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>conscience. I'm

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Decidedly. Are

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Don't joke,
Doctor: it's a serious affair. It's a breach of trust on my part, and I can't

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Because you were

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I can't give
advice on such general information. I must know particulars.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I will state a
case.  Suppose a very sick and dying girl confided to your care a letter or
letters containing her last words to a dear friend, name unknown. Suppose that
years passed and you never thought of the trust, and at last, when you had
reason to suspect you had found the right person, the letters were lost. Suppose
that this person was a dreadful sufferer for want of the words which are probably
in those lost letters. What would you do, Dr. Ross?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I am very sorry
for you, my dear child, if you are in such trouble as that. Can't you inform
the person of the contents of the letters?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;If I only knew
what the contents are, and that he is the right one to receive them. Years had
passed since she had heard from her friend, and she often said it would be a
relief to know that he had repented and died. I inferred that he had done her
some great wrong, and she had told him she never would forgive him. Before she
died she did forgive him with all her heart, and with almost her last breath left
him her love and her blessing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Tell the person
that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;How can I be
sure he is the one, without the packet? It is enclosed in a business envelope,
directed to me. It is very aggravating that I cannot recollect her name—but
that I could find at the Home for the Sick. I knew her as Stella.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Have you made a
thorough search?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh, no! I have
not thought of it for years. Just before I was taken sick, something occurred
of a confidential nature, which led to a suspicion that he is the one I ought
to give it to. I began to search at once for it among papers I sent to the
country when I left Uncle Williamson's.  I have not looked for it here. I
cannot recollect seeing it for years. Now I want you to consent that I go to
work in earnest. If I don't find it,&quot; sighing heavily, &quot;what shall I
do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Let me think a
minute.&quot; He rose and paced the floor, while she gazed at his knitted
brows, clenching her hands in impatience for him to speak.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He came back to his
seat, and counted her pulse.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Well,&quot; he
said, with a grave smile, as he glanced into her eager, wistful face, &quot;if
you feel pretty sure you have a clew to the right individual, ask him some
leading questions. Has he ever heard of such a lady, naming her? If he is
ignorant, or pretends to be, you are relieved from that responsibility. If he
should prove to have known her, you can state the circumstance: of her sickness
and death, and the messages she left for a dear friend.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;But,
Doctor—&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, I know; and
I am trying to choose between two evils. You are recovering from a dangerous
illness, and are not fit for any excitement. On the other hand, it is possible
that the worry of mind, while waiting for strength, will do you equal harm; so
I will make a compromise. Your pulse is pretty steady. You may have as many
papers as you please brought here, where Miss Annie can help you search, if you
will promise to stop at once if you feel tired, take one of those sweet-tasting
pills, and go to bed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Thank you,
Doctor. I promise. Will you please ring the bell?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He laughed as he
complied. Then saying, &quot;I wish you great success,&quot; left the room.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In ten minutes Marion
was dressed and seated in an old-fashioned armchair, while within her reach was
a drawer of papers, pamphlets, etc., etc. Annie Leman sat on a cricket near by,
while James was bringing drawers and boxes from the storeroom.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Having explained what
she wanted to find, the work proceeded in silence, occasional sighs from Marion
being the only interruption. In less than two hours every paper had been
handled and thrown back.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Are you sure,
James, that you have brought all?&quot; The tone was sharp and decided.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, miss. Mrs.
Mitchell came to the attic and told me which to take, and she says there are no
more in the house.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Take them all
away, again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She sank back and
covered her face with her hands, but starting presently, she said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I am not keeping
my promise to the doctor, Annie. I must take one of those horrid pills, and go
to bed. I want to sleep and forget everything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The next day was so
pleasant that Mrs. Mitchell proposed she should take a drive; but Marion had no
heart for anything, unless, indeed, &quot;I could go to the Home for the Sick
and see Mary Falkner,—and I don't believe the doctor would let me do that. I
could ask Dr. B— to examine the record too. If Stella's name was Angus,
I—&quot; she stopped suddenly on hearing the doctor's step.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He came in while they
were discussing the subject, and ended it by saying she was to go and drive
around the park for an hour.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He contrived to send
every one from the room, and then asked,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What
success?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;None at all. I
have no hope, now, and have made up my mind to be as patient as I can till I am
well enough to see the one to whom I referred, and tell him what I know. I
think he will forgive me, but I can never forgive myself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>After this, she went
out every pleasant day for a week, and gained strength rapidly, notwithstanding
her abiding regret in regard to the lost packet. Then came a few days of wet
weather, when she was obliged to keep in-doors. She sent for her pupils, gave
them lessons, and heard them sing and play. She sent for new music for Annie,
and tried to interest herself in it. She purchased flowers and sent them to
Mrs. Douglass, who, under the care of an experienced physician, was gaining
strength daily. The first pleasant day she resolved to go to Grantbury, taking
James with her. Annie Leman had returned to her aunt, and was giving lessons to
her first pupils.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>One morning she stood
watching the cloud, which seemed to be blowing over, and said to herself,
&quot;To-morrow, if it clears up, I shall be off. What a relief it will be to
tell him, and be forgiven for my neglect of so sacred a trust!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She heard the bell
ring, and then James's voice asking whether she would see Mr. Belknap.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Certainly; ask
him up at once.&quot; She advanced eagerly to the door to meet her father's
aged friend, and her own legal adviser.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion's manner was
always charming in its heartiness, but towards her aged friends there was almost
a filial warmth, which made them feel that they were special favorites. She
seated the white-haired old man in her most comfortable chair, putting an
ottoman near him, where she could sit and look in his face.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You have been
near death, I hear,&quot; he said tenderly.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, sir; but
all that time was lost to me. I was not conscious of danger.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;God has been
good to you, my child. He has raised you up to new duties. You must be thankful
for all His mercies.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I must, indeed.
I want to be better for this sickness, more helpful of others not so favored as
I am, more humble and charitable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;That's right,
dear child. Ask for grace to improve each day's joys and sorrows, and you will
get it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He then talked to
Marion of business, saying, &quot;There are some papers which it will be
necessary for you to sign.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He had made a long
call, when the doctor came in, and, seeing Mr. Belknap, telegraphed to Marion
to speak to him in the hall. When there he only said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Tell your story
to him: he's a good friend to you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And she did tell him,
relating the death scene in the hospital more in detail than she had done
before. She told him also that she had accidentally met a person who was
burdened with a heavy grief, whose name, as nearly as she could recollect, was
the same. She had always called her friend by her first name, and the belief
grew stronger and stronger in her mind that he was the one to whom her dying
friend referred. An expression on the gentleman's face had first startled her
and carried her back in mind to her friend, and the recollection of the letters
left in her care.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He listened
attentively, not saying a word till she had finished the recital.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You say she died
in the Home, in the year 18—.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;And that he also
was in the same Home for months,—that he told the chaplain his story, as she
had told hers, probably.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, sir; but I
didn't think&quot;—she stopped abruptly, staring in his face, and then
exclaimed, &quot;Oh, if I could find that packet of letters! I begin to think
he cannot be the one after all. Perhaps her friend has long been dead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Where did you
keep the packet?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I must have put
it where I considered it safe at the time; but her story was so vague,—and she
never mentioned the relation in which this person stood to her. I fancied he
might have been her lover. I was young, and thought I was to keep it till
called for. I remember thinking as she was a foreigner it was not likely it
would ever be delivered to any one. When I left Uncle Williamson's, I kept some
papers here and sent the rest to Grantbury.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Except the green
box of deeds, etc., etc., we keep in our safe.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion started to her
feet, exclaiming, &quot;It is there! It is there! Let us go and get it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She rang the bell,
told James to have the carriage round as quickly as possible, hurried on her
hat and sacque, looking so eager and hopeful that her old friend said,
cautiously,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Don't be too
sure, my child.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She turned to him, her
whole face dimpled with smiles.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'm almost as
sure,&quot; she said, &quot;as though I had it in my hand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In a few minutes she
stood at the lawyer's table, while a clerk was sent for the green box. One
minute more, papers tied with red tape, worth thousands of dollars, and nicely
filed receipts were scattered over the table. Near the bottom lay the missing
packet, which, with a scream of joy,—&quot;That's it,&quot;—she caught and held
to her breast.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I can't sign
anything to-day,&quot; she answered, as the younger partner requested her to
wait a few minutes. &quot;If you will send the papers round, I'll do it: I'm too
excited now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She ran down the
stairs, whispering over and over,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;God has been
very good to me&quot;; then to the coachman,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Home as quickly
as possible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Once in her own
chamber, she locked the door and, not waiting to remove her hat, tore off the
envelope; and there, written in a feeble hand, was the address,—&quot;Harold
Angus, formerly of Doncaster, Yorkshire, England.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She fell on her knees,
and thanked God. A strange calm stole over her, as she began to realize that it
was her privilege to lift the heavy burden from one whom she so greatly
respected, so admired for his many noble qualities.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She summoned James,
and sent him off to the telegraph office with this message:—</span></p>

<h1><a id="Part_1_Chapter_15"><span class='c8'>CHAPTER XV.</span></a></h1>

<h1><span class='c6'>A SAD STORY.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>To describe the scene
which followed, I will quote from the words of an eminent author.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Have you ever
watched the sun rise upon a landscape that has been, but a few moments before,
a world of gray and black shadows? Have you seen the rosy flush of dawn
creeping in lines of tender light across the hills, and shining down into the
valleys?&quot; If you have seen this  beauteous birth of day, and felt its full
significance of life renewed, then your imagination can fancy the dawn of the
new and perfect joy with which the young pastor received the intelligence contained
in the letters.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I have come at
your call,&quot; he had said, as he entered her parlor, where she met him with
outstretched hands. Looking full into his face she saw there the change of
which Annie had written. His eyes shone with a quiet courage, more touching
than the wildest despair. It was as though he had said, &quot;My Father has
sent me a cross. I will bear it manfully, looking to Him for strength.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion had been for
hours planning how she would break the news to the pastor. All was forgotten
now. Her voice rang with joy, as she said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I have news for
you,—good news. I knew your Stella. She gave me this for you. Only this morning
I first knew the address.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She put the precious
parcel in his hands, adding, &quot;When you have read it, I will come back and
tell you of her happy death. Please touch the bell when you are ready.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It was more than an
hour before the signal was given. When she re-entered the parlor his face bore
the marks of deep emotion; but the new light I have described at the beginning
of my chapter was shining from it.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Have you read
this?&quot; he asked, leading her to a seat, and taking one beside
her,—&quot;No, I do not mean that,—did she tell you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;When I first
found her, she talked of one who had blighted her life. She never named you. I
had no idea she alluded to a brother. After she went to the Home she became a
humble Christian, loving and tender to every one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He was struggling hard
to control his emotion, but presently said: &quot;How wonderful that, when you
were tending her and ministering to her wants like a sister, I was within a hundred
feet of her, crying and praying God so to soften her heart that she might
accept His forgiving love! How wonderful that my Father, in His wisdom, has
withheld this,&quot; holding up the letters, &quot;till by His grace He enabled
me to say from the heart, 'Thy will be done'!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;And gave me the
privilege of restoring to you the last token of her affection.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>As she spoke, Marion's
tears flowed fast. &quot;Will you thank Him for me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>As they knelt, he
poured from a full heart words of praise and thanksgiving. He consecrated his
life and all its powers anew to the service of the Saviour. He asked that
through these events, so mysterious, bringing to him, after the lapse of so
many years, the knowledge of his sister's acceptance of Christ as her Saviour, they
might both be more trustful, resting all their cares upon Him who had done all
things well.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Again and again Mr.
Angus asked for reminiscences of his sister. Again and again Marion related in
detail the account of their first meeting,—Stella's despair when first told she
could not live, her removal to the blessed Home, the sermon on forgiveness from
the chaplain, the arrow of the Spirit which sent it home to her heart, the
sweet and abiding peace which followed when she gave up her burden of sin and
sorrow to Christ.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Where is her
grave?&quot; he asked, concealing his face.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;In Greenwood. I
will take you there in the morning, and you will want to see Dr. B- at the
Home.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;In what words
can I thank you, Miss Howard? You not only befriended a poor orphan while
living, but provided a place for her in that lovely home for the dead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It was a
precious privilege, Mr. Angus.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Seizing her hand for a
moment, he dropped it suddenly and walked away to the window.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Tea is
served,&quot; announced James, opening the door.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;One word, Miss
Howard. Will you listen to my story? I want you to read my sister's letters. If
you will listen to me first, you will then understand the cause she had to
consider me her enemy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I should
consider it a sacred privilege.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;My good Hepsey,
Miss Prime, Mr. Angus,&quot; she added, advancing to the table, where Hepsey
sat. &quot;Mr. Angus is my Grantbury pastor, Ethel's friend,&quot; she
explained, as they took their seats.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>After grace had been
said, the conversation turned naturally to the family of Mr. Asbury, and
especially to Ethel.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>After a while Mr.
Angus asked,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Have you heard
from Mrs. Douglass of late?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, she has
revived in a wonderful manner. I intend to visit her as soon as my doctor
removes the embargo he has placed on me. He has the lowest opinion of my
prudence, and imagines me incapable of caution.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;And he is
right,&quot; insisted Hepsey, laughing. &quot;Once you begin your visits, there
is no knowing when they will end, until you are brought up again by some other
contagious disease.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I am engaged
this evening, James, if any one calls,&quot; remarked Marion, as they rose from
the table and returned to the parlor. &quot;Now, Mr. Angus I want to introduce
you to my dear friends, Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell, who have kindly made a home for
me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The conversation for a
few moments was of a general character, and then Mrs. Mitchell said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;We should be
happy to entertain you to-night, Mr. Angus. James will show you to your room,
when you wish to retire.  I will not say good-by, as I shall see you at the
breakfast-table.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It was evidently a
relief that the restraint of others' presence was removed. The pastor wanted
time to realize his new situation,—freed from the harrowing reminiscences which
had so long oppressed him,—and especially he wanted to narrate to the dear
friend who had done so much for him and his sister the actual experiences she
now only surmised. He sat quietly following with his eyes her movements as she placed
a screen on the gas-shade, moved a vase of flowers to the table, folded a
newspaper, and performed those little acts of womanly refinement which make the
delight and comfort of a home.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;May I tell you
now,&quot; he said, softly, as she seated herself opposite him; &quot;and will
you be charitable toward the faults of a wayward youth, as you have been to the
failings of the man?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Her bright smile
encouraged him, and he dashed into his story at once.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I was born in
Doncaster, Yorkshire, twenty-nine years ago. Two years later I had a sister
Stella. When I was ten and Stella eight, my mother died, leaving behind her an
infant boy, whom father named Wilson, for his maternal grandfather. A sister of
my father came to keep house, and care for the baby. I might have helped her, but
I fear I made her hard task harder. Stella was naturally wilful, strong in her
likes and dislikes, capable of the warmest affections. She took little Will, as
we always called him, to her heart, and made an idol of him.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Father never
seemed the same after mother's death. I can remember him sitting, his arms
folded, lost in his own thoughts and memories of the past.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I grew up with
little restraint. To do myself justice, I pitied father so much that I often
went away and wept. I loved Will too; but Stella was jealous if I separated him
from her, and I gradually let him alone, except as I wanted to tease her.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Occasionally,
when I was too abusive, she appealed to father; otherwise she took Will and
shut herself in a room with him, where I could not get at her.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;In my thirteenth
year father woke to the face that I needed a master. He sent me to a military
school, and promised that if I would do my best he would purchase a commission
for me in the army. I did fairly well in my studies, and went home in my
uniform, carrying a prize for good conduct. As I recall my actions at that time,
I must have been a great nuisance. Stella told me frankly that she wished I
would go back to school and never return. Aunt Sarah was almost beside herself,
settling disputes between us. Poor little Will used to scream and run away when
I went near him, at which I did not wonder, for he was taught to consider me an
enemy.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Father was more
feeble than ever, and passed much of his time in his chamber. I might have been
a comfort to him, but I was not.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It was nearly
three years before I was allowed to go home again. Aunt Sarah told me that
Stella persuaded father to keep me away. I had grown in that time from a boy to
a man. My military drill had made me strong and vigorous. I was fond of
athletic games, and my companions thought I excelled in them.  I could hunt and
row all day long without fatigue, and was never so happy as when excited by competition
in study or in athletic exercise.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;But there were
hours when I longed for home, for a mother's unexacting affection. I
accompanied my classmates to their homes and witnessed the mother's pride in
her boy, her lavish affection poured out on him, notwithstanding his faults. I
realized that I should be better with the incentive of a mother's approbation
to spur me on.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I was fond of
children too, and in my long, enforced absence, I came to idealize my little
brother. I planned how I would win his confidence, and help him to a happier
life than I had had.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I was summoned
home to father's death-bed. Dear father! When it was too late, he realized that
he had allowed his grief to swallow up every other feeling.  He—asked my
forgiveness,—dear father!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>His choking voice
interrupted the story for a few moments, and Marion's moistened eye; showed
that her interest was intense. After pause, he went on,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Father had
settled his worldly affairs before my return. His property was not large. It
was equally divided between my sister, my brother and myself. Part of mine was
to be spent in the purchase of a soldier's commission. He lived two days after
I reached home. I am glad to remember that he forgave me all my waywardness and
folly, commending me at the last to the care of my mother's God.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;This affliction
drew Stella and myself together and for a few weeks we lived more peaceably
than we ever had done; but she was still jealous of any interference with Will,
so that my dreams of winning his love ended suddenly.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I had my gun at
home, and Will used to beg Stella to let him go with me. He was continually
saying that he would be a soldier when he was a man. He used to look after me
as I went out with my gun over my shoulder. I gratified him a few times firing
at a mark, and then I allowed him from the window to see me load my gun.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;One morning,—oh,
how vividly every circumstance comes back to my mind! even the fragrance of the
white rose-bushes, and the pretty hedge all in bloom,—I was unusually
aggravated by poor Stella's unreasoning jealousy, and I answered with some hard
words. I reproached her with having made my life miserable. I told her I came
home resolved to be loving and patient. I reminded her that we were orphans,
and ought to love each other; and then, as she called me some undeserved names,
I retorted angrily that I was the eldest, the proper guardian of the family,
and that I would use my authority to take Will from her to prevent his being
ruined.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Will stood by
me, and listened to all the talk. Then, as I angrily left the house, he ran
after me and had to be carried back by force. I was frightened at the violence
of his temper, and, to soothe him, said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'If you'll go
back, you may play soldier with my gun.' I had fired it off in the early
morning, and left it standing behind the door.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I soon repented
of my anger, and was ready as usual to blame myself. I will be more patient, I
said, over and over again.    I had always trusted in my own strength, and of
course had failed. I turned back and entered the house. Will was alone. Stella,
not expecting me, had left him by himself, for a punishment. He looked guiltily
in my face, and I said, Come, let's make up and be friends. I'll teach you to
be a soldier.'</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I took the gun
and playfully aimed it at him, knowing it was not loaded. Alas! alas! There was
a loud report, and Will, my poor little Will, fell to the floor.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;My aunt and
Stella rushed to the room and found me with the gun in my hand, dumb and
immovable with horror. With a shriek I shall never forget, Stella caught Will
in her arms; but when I approached she waved me off, calling me a murderer, and
shouting again and again, 'I will never forgive you,—never! Never!'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Aunt Sarah
helped move Will to a bed, sent for the doctor, and then, beckoning me into
another room, shut the door, and said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Harold, tell me
truly. How did it happen?'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Somebody loaded
the gun after I went out. I thought it was empty. I wish it had killed me,
instead of my brother.' Six feet tall as I was, I laid my head on the table and
sobbed like a child.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'You must get away
from here,' Aunt Sarah said, putting her hand softly on my head,—the first
caress I had had for years.  'Stella is wild with anger. Will is dyin and she
will say you murdered him.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Where shall I
go?' I cried. 'I'm an outcast, like Cain; and yet the moment it happened loved
my brother better than I ever did in my life.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I was delirious
with grief and remorse. I went from the house, and passed the night on mother's
grave. I can recall little after that time, till found myself on board a vessel
bound for the United States. Stella's letter will tell you what happened in the
interim. What comfort the knowledge of those weeks would have been to me all these
years, you can scarcely imagine. Will died of the wound inflicted by my hand,
but not until he had confessed that he had loaded the gun while left alone. He
called for me continually but poor Stella was, as she expresses it, possessed
of a devil, and would not send for me. She continually denounced me as a
murderer, and Aunt Sarah had to explain again and again how it had happened.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I resolved then
and there to leave the money father left me for her use. I was reckless, and
did not desire to live.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;As you will read in
her letter, Stella says that she saw me at the funeral, and almost repented
when she perceived how changed I was. I have not the slightest recollection of
being there.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I landed in
Charleston, S. C., and made my way to Philadelphia, where I found the means of
living while I pursued my studies. I gave up military life, and thought I should
be content if I could fit myself for an editor of a paper. I was in an editor's
office in New York, when I was seized with fever and carried to the Home for the
Sick. I came away with new aims, and only longed to benefit some poor afflicted
ones as I had been benefited there. You know the rest. I studied three years at
the seminary, working among the poor meanwhile, and had just begun to preach
when I was requested to supply the pulpit for a pastor who had been my most
faithful adviser. I was called to Grantbury, and accepted the call. How nearly I
retracted my acceptance, weighed down with a sense of my unfitness for the
work, how I besought God with strong crying and tears to appear for me and let
me know His will, no one but He knows.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;There are poor
Stella's letters. I have blamed her, but not half so much as she blames
herself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion covered her
face with her handkerchief. The story was sad indeed.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Perhaps I have
done wrong to tell you all this,&quot; he urged, rising and walking the room.
&quot;You are the only confident I ever had.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;No, no, not
wrong. I thank you. If deal Stella could only have lived to tell you herself
how fully she forgave you, how earnestly she longed for your forgiveness!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;At first,&quot;
added Mr. Angus, &quot;I used to pity myself; but when I had received
forgiveness of my heavenly Father, my pity was for her. I remembered that the
unforgiving cannot receive forgiveness of God. I felt that my life was rendered
desolate, but I was willing to receive that as a chastisement. My prayer was,
'Lord, let her forgive that she may be forgiven.' The idea of her suffering
from poverty never occurred to me. Of late, when I have witnessed the happiness
of home life,—fathers and mothers with their children growing up around them,—I
have thought that, had my life been different, I might have been blessed with a
paradise of a home.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;All the sadness
is over now,&quot; murmured Marion, softly.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Do you think a
man with such a past as mine has a right to ask any one to share his
future?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>What Marion might have
answered had there not been a knock at the door, I cannot tell. James entered,
and carried to his mistress a note on a salver.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I told you I
could see no one to-night.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, miss, but
the messenger persists. He's from the Home for the Sick.&quot;</span></p>

<h1><a id="Part_1_Chapter_16"><span class='c8'>CHAPTER XVI.</span></a></h1>

<h1><span class='c6'>STELLA'S CONFESSION.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>MRS. ASBURY was
sitting at work in her room when she heard the outer door open and a quick step
on the stairs.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Who can that
be?&quot; she asked, somewhat surprised.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;No one but Mr.
Angus has a key, ma.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;He never steps
like that, Annie. Open the door and see.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Before she could do
so, the step came down again and Mr. Angus came into the sitting-room holding
out his hand as he greeted them.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Both mother and
daughter started up to meet him, and Ethel, hearing his voice, came running in,
and stood for a moment gazing in wonder. In her childish way she gave
expression to their thoughts.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It's a new Mr.
Angus.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, it is,
darling,&quot; he said, catching her in his arms. &quot;That other Mr. Angus
has gone away, and I hope never to see him any more.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Turning to Mrs.
Asbury, he said, &quot;God has been very good to me, and sent me the best of
news from an absent friend. I have long mourned her as dead; now I learn that
she died in faith, trusting in the blood of Christ to wash away all her
sins.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I am truly glad
for you,&quot; was her earnest reply.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;The intelligence
I have received renders it necessary for me to go to England for a short time.
I want to ask your husband's advice concerning arrangements for my pulpit
during my absence.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;How long shall
you be away?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Probably three
months.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You have six
weeks' vacation. Why not include those, and get a supply for the rest?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Thank you for
the suggestion. It is my wish to leave as soon as possible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>This was all the
explanation he gave as to the change in his conduct, a change recognized by
every one in the parish. His voice, his step, his manner, were cheerful even to
buoyancy. His smile was more frequent, and had lost forever the sadness which
formerly often accompanied it.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The very boys in the
street watched and wondered. Formerly, when he passed the play-ground, he gazed
at them, but in so serious a manner that they felt almost guilty; now it was
very different. He stood one day at the entrance to a large field, given up to
the use of the boys for base-ball, watching the game with great interest.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;No, that is not
the way,&quot; he shouted at last, leaping at one bound over the high fence.
&quot;This was the way when I was a boy.&quot;  He gave the ball a kick, which
sent it to the farther corner of the field, and stood laughing at the loud
cheers which rent the air, then saying,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Play fair, boys;
cheating don't pay,&quot; he gave another leap and passed on, taking off his

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>A supply for the
pulpit was readily obtained from a theological school, and passage engaged in a
Cunarder; but, as the reader may not understand the necessity which called him
to leave Grantbury, I will take the liberty to insert here extracts from the
letters in the recovered package.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>These were now in the
hands of Marion, and he was to receive them when he went to New York to take
the steamer. It is unnecessary to say that the young lady, having listened to
the story of the brother, devoted her first leisure to reading the confession
of the sister.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The very first lines
deeply moved her, recalling, as she did, Stella bolstered up in her bed at the
Home as she wrote, her curtain drawn closely to shut out the sight of her
companions.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The letter began:—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>If I have a
brother, and these words ever meet his eyes, let him read</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>them as coming from
one who has deeply sinned against him, but who</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>has also deeply repented.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Judge her as
charitably as you can, my brother, even as I trust God</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>will judge me; and
remember that my prayers have gone up to God</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>continually for
you, and my loving thoughts reach far away across the</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>waters, where, if
still among the living, I suppose you are now.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;How
strange!&quot; reflected Marion, &quot;that when she wrote that her</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>brother was in an
adjoining ward, and that one minute's walk would</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>have taken him to
her side.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Later.—I had to lay
aside my pen and rest, and now my hands tremble</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>with weakness; but
justice to one who has never received justice at</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>my hands urges me
to make my confession. Harold, I cannot remember</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>the time when I did
not feel jealous of you. As a child, you were</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>loving in nature,
winning your way without effort to every heart.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>You were mother's
pet and pride. Father could scarcely see a fault</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>in his big, brave,
and beautiful boy. When Aunt Sarah came, all that</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>I could say to
prejudice her against you had no effect. She loved and</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>trusted you. She
said you would love me if I would let you. She said</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>few had so
forgiving a nature. She tried to persuade me to be at</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>peace and allow
Will, my idol, to love you. I will say that when we</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>used to walk into
church, I was proud of you. All my companions</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>envied me and my
brother. This made me hate you more than ever.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>If you had been
plain and unattractive, I think it would have been</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>different with
me,—but perhaps not, for my heart was full of envy</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>and jealousy. Now
you know the secret of all my conduct. I was</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>possessed with a
devil and, instead of trying to cast him out,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>I cherished him.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Harold, before you
reached home to see father die he begged me</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>to love you as I
loved Will. He gave Will into your special care.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>He wrote you a
loving letter, telling you his plans and wishes</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>for your future,
that he left the care of Will's education and his</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>little property to
you. If he died, it was to be yours. If you died,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Will was to inherit
what you left. How I hated him for this! I had</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>a legacy from Aunt
Mary which, with my share, would be enough for me,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>he said. How I
hated him for writing this! The breath had scarcely</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>left his body
before I tore the paper to pieces. Will you forgive</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>me, brother?</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Later.—I must
hasten on, for my life is fast drawing to a close,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>and I have that to
tell you which will relieve you of a great sorrow,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>—I mean in regard
to the last dreadful scene at home. Tears stream</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>from my eyes as I
remember your patience with me, your efforts to win</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>my sisterly love.
Oh how one expression of yours has rung in my</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>memory!</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;Sister
Stella, why won't you let me love you? I will try to please</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>you, and we might
be so happy?&quot; Oh, why! why!</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>You asked Will to
go to walk.  He started, and I ran and forced him</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>back. To punish
him, I shut him up in the room, forgetting that you</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>had placed your gun
behind the door. In my insane terror I charged</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>you with murdering
him, Harold. Before he died he confessed that he</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>had loaded it,—put
in the very bullet that was to end his life.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Harold, can you
forgive me when I say that I knew this when I saw you</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>at his funeral, and
did not tell you? Yes, when I saw you so changed</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>that I scarcely
recognized you, I kept his dying messages, which</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>would have relieved
your sorrow. I charged you with being his</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>murderer, but no
one believed me. Aunt Sarah did you justice. She</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>told every one you
loved the boy, and that he loved you,—that it</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>was an accident.
After Will confessed that he loaded the gun,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>she repeated this
to every one. You were pitied, and I, who so</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>idolized the boy,
was looked on with suspicion. Even Aunt Sarah told</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>me that I had
ruined Will by indulgence, or he would never have</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>touched the gun
contrary to your orders. I hated her for saying it,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>but I knew that
what she said was true.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Later.—I am already
relieved by my confession, and, as I feel</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>stronger this
morning, I will write while I can. I shall commit this</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>to the care of a
dear friend, who first led me to hope for pardon</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>through Christ. I
can never tell any one how much she has been to me.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Beautiful,
accomplished, and rich, she devotes herself and all she</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>has to the divine
work of winning others to her Saviour.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Dear brother, I
wish you could meet such a friend. If you have never</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>sought Christ let a
sister's dying words prevail. His love is more</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>precious than all
the world beside. If I, with all my load of guilt</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>can receive
forgiveness, no one need despair. I told you I would</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>never forgive you.
One day I heard a sermon from the young chaplain</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>of the Home, where
I was staying. He repeated the words of our</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Saviour, &quot;If
ye forgive not men their trespasses,&quot; etc., and</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>explained the
wretched, despairing condition of those who cherish</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>a spirit of
unforgiveness.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Every word applied
to my case. The gracious spirit of God carried</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>home the truth to
my heart, and helped me to accept his conditions</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>of mercy. The whole
room seemed filled with light. Never had I</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>conceived such joy,
such peace, as flowed in upon my soul.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>From trying to
invent excuses for my own base conduct, I saw myself</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>the vilest of the
vile.  I realize now that murder had been in my</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>heart,—murder of a
brother. I love you now. I wonder at your</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>forbearance when I
reproached you. How pityingly you used to gaze</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>on me! I seem to
see your eyes now,—eyes like our mother's,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>so sweet, so
sad,—looking into mine as though you would say,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;Stella, I
want to love you. Why can't we be at peace?&quot; O Harold,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>my brother, would
that I could see you once more and ask your</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>forgiveness!  Aunt
Sarah often said that I had driven you from home</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>and friends. It is
true. I grieve over it, and have asked God</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>to forgive me. I
pray that we may meet in heaven: you will forgive me</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>there.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Before I close, I
must tell you that immediately after Will's death</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>I went home with
Aunt Sarah, and remained till she died. In the bank</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>where father left
your money, you will find my share and Will's.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>I have never drawn
one pound.  I could not, as I had made it over</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>to you. My legacy
has sufficed. I want you to accept mine (Will's is</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>yours by right)
from a sister who has learned not only to love but to</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>admire you. I found
letters from your teachers in the military school</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>to father. They
wrote of you in the highest terms. Father used to</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>read them over and
over. I did not see them till after his death.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'> </span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>One favor I would like
to ask.  If you ever receive this, will you</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>repay the faithful
friend I have mentioned the amount she has</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>expended for my lot
in Greenwood,—she has promised to follow me</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>there,—and any
other expense incurred for my sickness beyond the</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>$60 I leave in my
purse?</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Later.—The end is
drawing near. I am not afraid: Christian friends</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>are about me.  My
own loved Marion will be here presently, and will</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>not leave me till
Jesus, my Saviour calls me home. I have an</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>assurance this
morning that my prayers for you will be answered.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>We shall meet
father and mother and all our loved ones in heaven.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Farewell, dear
Harold, farewell!</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Afternoon.—God has
seen fit to keep me here a little longer. I have</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>not told you that I
came to America two years ago,—after Aunt</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Sarah's death. I
was in a boarding house with an acquaintance from</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>home, and taught
music when a sudden cold settled on my lungs.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Miss Howard heard
me sing once at a party given by one of my pupils</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>and afterward
called when she learned I was sick.  She is a great</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>lover of music. She
has been such a friend to me as I cannot</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>describe. This Home
for the Sick has proved a paradise to many.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Thank God, who sent
me here. Once more, brother, farewell! Meet me</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>in heaven.</span></i></p>

<h1><span class='c6'>THE CRIPPLED BOY.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>DURING Marion's call
at the Home for the Sick in company with the pastor, they examined the record
of patients, etc., and related to Dr. B— the singular circumstance of the
brother and sister, natives of another country, being there at the same time,
each longing to find the other, and remaining unknown. There were the names and
dates fully recorded:—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Men's Medical
Ward, Harold Angus, New York, aged twenty-four. Disease, typhoid fever. Entered
March 7, 18—. Discharged cured June 20, 18—. Address of friends, Mr. James
Whitney, New York City.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Women's Medical
Ward, Stella Angus, Doncaster, England, aged twenty-two. Second admittance.
Disease, consumption. Entered May 2, 18—. Died June 4, 18—. Place of burial,
Greenwood. Address of friends, Miss Mary Angus, Leyden, England.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I recollect
perfectly,&quot; remarked Dr. B—, &quot;that Stella, as we called her,—from
Miss Howard introducing her by that name,—often spoke to the chaplain and to
the nurses of one whom she had injured, and that she wished to atone for it. I
never heard, Mr. Angus, that you mentioned her name.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I never did. I
supposed her to be in England. I can only believe that God, for His own wise
purpose, kept the knowledge of her triumphant death from me till I could say,
in regard to all His dealings, 'Thy will be done.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>From the Home they
drove at once to Greenwood. The lot was small and inexpensive, but it had been
well cared for, and the grave, covered with myrtle, was green and beautiful.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion led the way to
the spot and then retired to a distance, leaving the mourner alone with his
sorrow. Not yet did she know how deeply Stella had injured her brother, and so
she could not appreciate, as she did afterward, the abandonment of his grief as
he fell on the grave, saying,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;My sister! My
sister! Is it thus we meet?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Still, as she walked
away, with bent head and fast-falling tears, she repeated to herself the
familiar quotation,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;To err is human,
to forgive, divine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>At the head of the
grave Marion had caused a simple stone to be erected, with merely these words,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>STELLA.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>ASLEEP IN JESUS.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>As they were turning
to leave the sacred spot, he pointed to it, and tried to utter the words,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Thank you,&quot;
but his voice choked.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Now, he in whom she
had taken so deep an interest, whose happiness had for a time been so
intimately interwoven with her own, had sailed for England. He had made a hasty
call, on his return from Grantbury, and received from her the precious letters
assuring him of his sister's affection. He had seemed ill at ease when she thanked
him for allowing her to peruse them, pressed her hand warmly as he bade her
farewell, took his hat from the table in the hall then suddenly threw it down
again, exclaiming,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I cannot leave
you without saying, if we never meet again, I shall die blessing you for your
goodness to Stella and to me. Miss Howard, you have opened a new future before
me. You—but I cannot,—I ought not to say more. Will you add one favor to the
many I have received at your hands? Will you answer a letter from me? May I
tell you of my visit to my native land, to the graves of my parents?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He fixed his eyes full
on hers, which at last fell before the ardor of his gaze, while she answered
frankly,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Mr. Angus, for
Stella's sake and for your own, I shall be very glad to hear from you. My time
will be spent among my poor. If I find anything to interest you, I will
certainly write in answer to yours.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion was practical
rather than sentimental, and she plunged into the business of life as though
nothing more than usual had occurred.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In one day, she
visited Mary Falkner at the Home, gave music lessons to four pupils, went with
Hepsey nearly a mile to inquire for one of her mission boys, and brought home
for evening work one of the rolls from the mission chapel, in order to stencil
an additional hymn upon it.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Still, wherever she
went, however employed her thoughts were with a lonely traveller whom the waves
were every hour carrying farther and farther away. While driving, with Hepsey
by her side, through the thronged thoroughfares, or sitting at her own
well-spread board, the question constantly recurred: &quot;Why did he say, 'if
we never meet again'? Does he not expect to return?&quot; Then her pulse beat
more warmly as she recalled the expression of his eye, and added, &quot;I know he
hoped we should meet again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In the morning Mr.
Lambert called, and found her leaning over the large table in the dining room,
printing with the stencil plate the hymn, work which company had obliged her to
postpone the previous evening.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He had scarcely taken
his seat before he began to scold her.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You ought to
have a guardian,&quot; he began, in loud voice. &quot;Pale as ashes,—taking
work out of the printer's hands, too. Well, they may starve for all I care.
World upside down, as usual.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Will you please
help me roll this?&quot; asked Marion, turning an arch, smiling face full upon
him. &quot;It must be held very tight, or it will wrinkle. Mr. Lambert, why
don't you help me in my mission school?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Help—mission
school—insane idea—couldn't get any scholars—pretty teacher, indeed!&quot; He
grumbled away for some time to himself, and finally ended with a fit of
laughter. &quot;All nonsense,—throwing away money on bummers, stuff and
nonsense—embryo thieves and murderers.&quot; He walked to the window, pretended
to be examining the flowers in the conservatory, pulled out his purse and
quickly concealed a bill in his hand just as Marion, who had finished her work,
said, pleasantly,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You needn't try
to deceive me with your grumbling: I found you out long ago. You would go a
mile any time to carry food to the hungry, only you would want the privilege of
scolding them afterwards.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The eccentric old
gentleman hung his head, too much confused even to grumble at her.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;How guilty you
look!&quot; laughed Marion. &quot;You took me in, once upon a time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Aye! aye!
Frightened you well, that's some comfort.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I don't think I
was much frightened, though I confess I considered your manner rather rough. I
recollect well that I pitied you for being so suspicious of everybody.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He sprang from the
floor, shouting,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Suspicious, eh?
Suspicious, is it? Pitied me, did you? If any one else had dared,—well, I'm an
old fool, anyway.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He sat down and wiped
the perspiration from his forehead, looking so pale and hurt that Marion pitied
him more than ever. She drew a chair close to his side and said, soothingly,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Now that we
understand each other, I want to tell you a story,—a true one. You know Hepsey
and I go out sometimes to see our friends in the back alleys.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Humph! Yes,—and
bring home fevers, and all that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;One day I heard
a woman crying,—and true enough she had cause. Her boy had been crushed by a
wheel which ran over his legs; and there he lay on a pile of straw, in a
fainting fit. I tried to bring him to while Hepsey went for an ambulance, and
we soon had him in the care of the doctor, on his way to the hospital. Hepsey
and I followed with the mother. To make a long story short, the injury was so
great that Neddy—that's his name—had both his legs amputated just above the
knees, and he is well again. Now the question is, What can he do to earn his
living? He's a dear, patient little fellow, and he has made friends of
everybody at the hospital. One of the doctors has given me five dollars
for—&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Lambert threw down
his cane, and pulled out his purse again.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;No, I don't want
money now, I want advice. He can't earn his living yet awhile; but what can he
be fitted for?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'll get him a
place in a printing-office.&quot; In his excitement, Mr. Lambert forgot to
grumble.  His voice was natural and agreeable.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Just the thing!
But isn't he too young,—he's only nine?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;That's a fault
easily cured. He must be put into the Five Points Mission School till he's
twelve,—learn to read and spell, and all that sort of thing. Where is he?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;In the hospital.
Will you go with me to see him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Certainly not. 
Why should I go? I've nothing to do with it, any way. You wanted advice and I
gave it,—that's all. Don't be nonsensical now,&quot; putting another bill
stealthily on the table. &quot;What did you say the fellow's name is?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Neddy Carter. He
isn't strong enough to be carried to that old, tumble-down attic, and so I have
engaged a friend to take him home with her till he can have his artificial legs
made. That's what the doctor subscribed five dollars for.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Wooden legs, eh!
That's the plan, is it? Five dollars! Tell this doctor to mind his own
business. I know a man—that is, he owes me—that is, he will owe me—a bill, and
I'll get the legs out of him—see if I don't. I'll&quot;—grumbling. &quot;Well,
I'm going. I don't find your story very entertaining. It's lucky I'm forgetful:
shan't know anything about it to-morrow. Good-day, Miss Howard. Don't make a
fool of yourself more than you can help.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He caught his cane and
was crossing the room when he saw the bill he had first taken from his pocket
and forgotten lying on the floor.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Pretty way to
use good money,&quot; he said, with a sneer, pointing to it. &quot;With all
your teaching business, you'll never get rich that way, Miss Howard.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I saw that bill
drop from your hand, sir.&quot; Marion laughed till all her dimples came into
play. &quot;But you can't have it,&quot; she insisted, as she saw his look of
disappointment at being found out. &quot;You've forfeited the right to it, and
I shall add it to my fund for Neddy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Pretty sharp
practice that,&quot; he grumbled, looking intensely relieved. &quot;Well,
good-day to you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The next time Marion
went to the hospital a singular circumstance occurred,—a circumstance which
unravelled for her quite a mystery.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She inquired for Neddy
Carter, and was allowed to proceed at once to the convalescent ward. The boy
was sitting in a low chair, which he had learned to wheel about with great
rapidity. As soon as he saw her, his face brightened, and before he could reach
her side he shouted,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Miss Howard!
Miss Howard! Mr. Regy's been here!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;And he's such a
funny man,&quot; said one of the older boys.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I wish I had
seen him,&quot; was Marion's answer. &quot;What did he come for?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;To see me. He
was awful cross at first, and scolded me for getting under the wheel like
sixty; but I know him, and he's real good for all that; and I like him; and
when I told him I didn't get under the wheel on purpose he gave me this,&quot;
pulling a silver dollar from his pocket. &quot;Will you please take it to help
buy my wooden legs?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;No, indeed;
those will be ready when the doctor says you can wear them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Mr. Regy says
I'm to be a printer,&quot; continued the boy, fixing his large brown eyes on
hers; &quot;and I'm to go to school at the Five Points, and learn to read and
spell, and by-and-by, he says, there's no knowing but I may be a great man, and
print newspapers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion started. This
was Mr. Lambert's plan. Had he told Mr. Regy of it?</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;How does Mr.
Regy look?&quot; This inquiry was addressed to one of the nurses, who was
passing.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Very
oddly,&quot; she replied, laughing. &quot;He's about fifty or sixty years old,
very gray hair, which he wears long, floating over his shoulders.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion laughed too as
she said, &quot;I've often heard of him, but I never saw him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Lambert was over
sixty; but his hair, naturally light, had not turned gray, and was cut short to
his head.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;He stoops a
little,&quot; added the nurse, &quot;and makes frightful faces. Some of the
little ones were afraid of him, but before he went away he coaxed them to sit
in his lap and put their hands in his pockets, where they found nuts and
raisins and candy in abundance. A lady came in to see a little cripple, and as
she passed him surrounded by a group of them, Neddy's chair rolled as close as
he could get it, she remarked, smiling, 'It's a blessed work, sir.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Mr. Regy had not
seen her before, and he started to his feet, looking very angry.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Troublesome
little brats!' he shouted, pushing them away.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Just like Mr.
Lambert,&quot; was Marion's reflection. &quot;How very strange there should be
two such men!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Just then she noticed
that several of the boys were putting their heads together, whispering and
gesturing as they looked toward her. Presently one came forward, and asked,
timidly,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Will you please
sing us a tune, Miss Howard?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;How do you know
I can sing?&quot; she asked, with one of her brightest smiles.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I heard you at
the mission Sunday school. I'm Maurice Long, what used to be sent to the back
seat for being allus in mischief.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Maurice looked
anything but humble, as he confessed his faults.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Why,
Maurice!&quot; exclaimed Marion, holding out her hand. &quot;You have grown so
much I did not know you,—and you are so pale, too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, miss. Me
and another boy got into a fight, and I had my head smashed in, and the p'lice
brought me here. I'm going out next week.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;O Maurice!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion was interrupted
by several voices shouting, &quot;He'd fight agin, ma'am. He'd oughter. It was
ter save a feller littler than him. Hurrah for Maurice!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;How was it,
Nurse? I want to hear the story.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Maurice had a
chance to earn a dime carrying a bundle for a gentleman from the cars. A little
fellow came along, leading a poor, half-starved dog of which he seemed very
fond. Just then a big bully of a boy met them, and began to tease the dog. When
his owner timidly begged to be let alone, the bully flew at him, and then
Maurice thought it time to interfere. He caught the bully by the hair, and would
not let go till he was terribly bruised. A policeman came up and arrested both
the boys, just as Maurice fainted from loss of blood. The gentleman had seen
the whole fight from beginning to end, and he followed the bully to the
court-room and gave his testimony, and called Maurice a hero.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;And a good
fighter, too,&quot; added Maurice, who had stood by, listening to all with a
kind of proud humility.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I am glad you
were not fighting to defend your own rights,&quot; said Marion, approvingly.
&quot;But who was the gentleman?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;He gave his name
as Lambert,&quot; said the nurse. &quot;There is a very curious sequel to the
story,&quot; she added, in a low tone, as they turned away.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Mr. Lambert came
here twice before Maurice was well enough to know him, and showed a good deal
of anxiety till he was out of danger, growling to himself that he ought to have
stopped the fight earlier. He gave the doctor some money for Maurice when he
goes away; but the boy knows nothing of that yet. When Mr. Lambert saw Maurice he
scolded him well; said a street fighter was a mean fellow and ought to be
arrested, and hoped he should never hear of his street brawls again.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;His voice was so
loud that some of the little ones began to cry, but Maurice spoke up rather
saucily,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'd fight for
you, sir, to-morrow, if you was hit. I know you're jolly, for all your
scolding.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Well,&quot; said
Marion, laughing heartily, &quot;what did Mr. Lambert say to that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Not a word that
we could understand. He went away with his handkerchief to his face, but when
he reached the street he shook all over with laughter.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Shall I sing for
the children now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;They will be
delighted to hear you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Standing in the midst
of the ward, with the little ones pressing to her side, Marion sang the sweet
melody set to the words,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Will you come
where the sweet-briar grows,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Where the heath flower
blossoms around? </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Will you come where
the hyacinth blows,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And the daisy just
peeps from the ground? </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>There's a bower by the
side of yon lake,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>'Tis the chosen abode
of the rose;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Where the wings of the
linnet awake</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The leaves from their
calm repose.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Every word was
distinctly enunciated, and the children, with bated breath and sparkling eyes,
proved their appreciation by calling out, &quot;More! Please, Miss Howard, sing
more.&quot; Smiling, she gave them the mocking-bird, which was followed by
shouts of applause.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>MISS HOWARD was
leaving the hospital when she met the doctor in charge, who invited her to his
private parlor, as he wished to consult her in regard to her protégé Neddy
Carter.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I suppose you

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I know him well

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Indeed! He is
certainly the most eccentric individual I ever met. Benevolent and
tender-hearted to an extreme, he seems to me like a man who has learned to
mistrust humanity so generally that he hides every evidence of weakness as carefully
as though it were a crime. Why, the good deeds that man does almost defy
belief.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I can easily
credit your statement, doctor. In my visits to my poor friends, I am constantly
hearing of him. I have known of his paying rent for a widow who had a sick
daughter, month after month, and at the same time providing her with medicines
and food. Yet he would talk to her about her untidyness till he made her cry;
and then he would go away grumbling that all he could say did no good.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I heard some
facts concerning his eccentricities from a gentleman who owns the place next
his in the country,&quot; continued the doctor, &quot;which, if they had not
come to me from the best authority I would not credit; but my friend vouches
for the facts.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Near them lives
a woman whose husband was killed on the railroad. She has two young children,
is pleasing in appearance, but wanting in force. They had always lived in
comfort, on the wages her husband earned. When he was killed, she seemed
crushed with grief. The neighbors made up a purse for her, and Mr. Regy, who
had given generously, was requested to carry it to her. He learned that she owned
her small cottage, to which a barn was attached, but had no money. He found she
had no idea of earning her own living, but when he proposed that the children
be sent to the asylum, and she go out to work in a mill or family, she cried
herself into hysterics, calling him a cruel, hard-hearted brute for proposing
it, wished he would go away and never come again.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;This is all my
friend learned from Mr. Regy, who denounced her as ungrateful, unnatural as a
mother, a pest to society. Her neighbors supposed, of course, he gave her up;
but he never did, for a day. He went and berated her till he quite roused her
into action; and finally she said she had been brought up on a farm, and knew
how to make butter and cheese.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'What good will
that do you?' he asked her, with a sneer. 'Where are your cows, to make
butter from?'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It was some time
before she learned what a true friend he was; but two excellent milkers found
their way to her barn, and, in time, pans and a churn. Then she complained that
she was sure she never could sell her butter and pot-cheese and cried a whole
day at the scolding he gave her. To make a long story short, he sold all her butter
and cheese for her at the highest price, taking the basket on his own arm, and
carrying it to the houses of the regular customers. A lady on Forty-Second
Street told my friend that he brought butter there regularly every week for
more than a year. She supposed it was from his own farm; and she has a pile of
his receipts signed M. Regy. Once she remonstrated in person with him for his
high prices, when he flew into such a rage that she never dared approach the
subject again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Very, very strange,&quot;
remarked Marion.  &quot;I have a friend who is extremely odd and uncouth in
manner, but is always doing kindnesses for the poor. His name is Lambert. In
many respects your description of Mr. Regy would answer for both.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Do you refer to
Mr. M. R. Lambert, a rich old bachelor?  Why, I always thought him the most
sarcastic, sour, crusty, old man in my acquaintance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Only in manner,
doctor. He possesses the milk of human kindness in an uncommon degree. He is a
second Mr. Regy. I am confident that any sum of money I would consent to ask
him for in behalf of my protégés would not be refused; and all the time he
would be grumbling that it was good money thrown away on a thankless class of
vagrants.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What is Mr.
Lambert's full address,&quot; inquired the doctor, rising in an excited manner.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;M. R. Lambert
are his initials. I have scores of his cards.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Regy is, I
believe, his middle name, and he uses it for a nom de plume. It can scarcely be
credited that there would be two so similar in their eccentricities. I am
almost sure of it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Then he must
disguise himself: Mr. Lambert's hair is short, and only beginning to turn
gray.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;A gray wig is
easy to procure. What can be his motive?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It is difficult
to conceive, Doctor. I have sometimes imagined that Mr. Lambert had a motive in
so constantly visiting the poorer classes; but it is only a suspicion. I feel
sure, if it were true, it would do honor to the kindness of the man. I told him
the story of Neddy Carter's injury. He entered into it with great interest,-said
he would get him a place in a printing-office and was almost angry that any one
else had thought of purchasing artificial legs for the boy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Just what I
wished to tell you from Mr. Regy. They are one and the same. Mr. Regy I shall
continue to call him. See, here is the address he gave me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;M. REGY, P.O. BOX
1009.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>On her way home,
Marion's thoughts were absorbed in trying to solve the motives which could
govern such a man as Mr. Lambert, and induce him to figure in so many different
characters; for the more she reflected the more she felt assured that he and
Mr. Regy were the same. It might be that some early disappointment had thus
twisted and gnarled a naturally lovely character.  It might be that some one he
had once loved and trusted had betrayed his confidence, and thus rendered him
suspicious of all mankind. She resolved to watch him closely, and to endeavor
to lighten his burden, whatever it might be.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Approaching her own
door, she perceived a carriage standing there. With her thoughts still on the
discovery she had made, she ran up the steps and encountered Eugene Cheriton
struggling in the arms of James, who had been told to take him back to his
mother in the parlor.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The boy readily
yielded to her wish, and went upstairs with her, where she was both surprised
and pleased to find not only Mrs. Cheriton but Mrs. Douglass awaiting her
arrival.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The latter lady seemed
to have taken out a new lease of life, since her return to the city. She
acknowledged that she liked New York, and should leave it with reluctance.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I hope you do
not intend to leave it,&quot; urged Marion.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The lady glanced
anxiously at her daughter before she answered. &quot;Necessity may compel us to
do so.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mrs. Cheriton's
countenance had no reflection of her mother's anxiety. She sat as usual, with
her handsome head thrown a little back, her large, black eyes lustrous as ever,
her lips wreathed in the same set smile; but there seemed no soul in her face. She
appeared to have wrapped herself in a veil, which, in Marion's presence, had
never been lifted for one instant.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Eugene, beautiful and
restless as ever, ran here and there unrestrained, demanding the reason for
this or that, preventing so effectually any attempt at conversation that
Marion, who wished for an opportunity to talk with Mrs. Douglass, at last
persuaded her to remain for the day, insisting that she herself had no
engagements which would interfere with the pleasure of such a visit.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;While you are
taking your siesta,&quot; she urged, &quot;I can go to my pupils; and then we
will have quiet chat, or drive in the park, as you prefer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;This is just the
opportunity I have long desired,&quot; remarked Mrs. Douglass, as after an
hour's rest she had partaken of a nice lunch, and was seated in Marion's most
comfortable chair. &quot;I want to tell you some facts in my early life which
will account for my being here in America.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I shall feel
honored by your confidence,&quot; returned Marion, gazing with affection into
the still beautiful face, so like and yet unlike her daughter's. &quot;Let me
bring my crocheting, and we can be as cosey as we please.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I told Mr. Angus
some things about our history. He may have repeated them to you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Not a word, dear
lady,&quot; bending over her work to conceal the rosy hue which colored her
cheeks at the mention of his name.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I told him,
that, although Juliette and myself are living alone, we are neither of us
widows,—at least we are not knowingly such,—but let me go back to early days.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;My father was an
Englishman, and in his thirty-first year was sent to Spain as minister from the
court of England. He was stationed at Madrid, where he met my mother, daughter
of a nobleman in that city. The liking between them was mutual, and ended in
marriage after an acquaintance of a few months. I have heard it said that
seldom had a couple so distinguished for beauty, and every charm which makes life
desirable, been witnessed in our proud old city.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;A year after
their marriage a son was born, who was named Henreich, for my maternal
grandfather. Three years later I appeared on the scene. As no other children
followed, and we were the only grandchildren on the mother's side, you can
easily imagine that our wishes, whims, and caprices ruled the entire household.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Henreich, beautiful,
bold, wilful, and unrestrained, became at last a terror to both parents and
servants. To me only was he loving and gentle; but even when in a fury of rage,
he would yield to my entreaties and tears. I need not say that he was my idol.
I loved him as sister never loved brother before. What I suffered when, unable longer
to endure the anxieties and terror which his bold daring continually occasioned
my parents, he was sent to England to be educated, I have no words to describe.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It could
scarcely be expected that a high-spirited lad, accustomed to have his own way,
would yield at once to authority; at least Henreich did not, and soon fell into
such disgrace that he was expelled from the school.  My uncle, to whose care he
had been committed, wrote, resigning the charge. He reproached my father in the
most unmeasured terms for neglecting to restrain the boy's temper, which had
led him in an ungovernable fit of fury to attempt the life of one of his
teachers, after which he fled, and nothing could be heard from him. Father went
to England at once. I never knew what occurred there, but when he came home he
said Henreich was dead to us, and forbade that his name ever be mentioned.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You will see
later why I dwell so long on these sad events. I mourned over my brother, and,
not being allowed to speak of him, I brooded over his troubles until at last I
forgot that he had been to blame for them. I even came to regard him as a hero,
who had been unjustly treated.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;All the fond
pride which would have been cherished for both of us was now lavished on me. I scarcely
had a wish but it was gratified. With the exception of my trouble at the
separation from my brother, I scarcely knew the meaning of the word, till in my
fourteenth year I accompanied my parents to England, and they left me to finish
my education.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I was now in the
same country where Henreich had been, but I never, except on one occasion,
heard his name mentioned. I asked my uncle Douglass if he knew where my brother
was, and was answered, with a terrible frown,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'No, I do not.
He may be dead, for all I care.'</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I never inquired
again.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I was in England
two years, and returned to Spain 'finished,' as my graduation from school with
high honors was called. It was then I entered on a course of gayety, such as I
had never even imagined. Though very young, my hand was asked frequently in
marriage; but my heart was never touched till one evening, at a gay assembly, I
met a young American, with whom I danced nearly all night. Only the third time
we met he told me he loved me, and asked me to be his wife. I confessed that I
returned his affection, and sent him to my father.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;But now, for the
first time in my life, I met opposition. My father and mother, foolishly fond
and proud of their only child, considered it quite beneath me to marry an
untitled foreigner. They talked as though royalty itself might be honored by an
alliance with me. This opposition naturally fixed my determination to marry the
man of my choice, notwithstanding all obstacles. I instantly invested him with
the whole catalogue of virtues and when, added to these, sadness on his part
proved his undying attachment, I made a martyr of him,—a martyr dying for my
love.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Under these
circumstances I gave my parents no rest. My lover offered letters to prove that
he was worthy; and at length, worn out by my entreaties and my evident loss of
bloom, father did secretly write to a friend in London, requesting him to
ascertain from Mr. Post, banker in that city, in regard to his position and prospects.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;This it was easy
to do through correspondents from the London Banking House, and the result was
so satisfactory, both as to character and wealth, that my friend was allowed to
renew his visits, which speedily terminated in my betrothal. I have often
thought since, that, had my parents allowed the acquaintance to proceed at first
without opposition, all would have ended differently; for as the intimacy
advanced, even before our marriage, I discovered certain traits which greatly
annoyed me.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I had been
accustomed to the expression of admiration, and enjoyed it; but I was faithful
and true to my lover. He considered the looks and tones of flattery an insult
both to me and to him. He constantly urged our immediate union; but to this my
parents would not consent, except on one condition. Until I was twenty-one, my
home must be with them. On my eighteenth birthday, with the reluctant consent
of all my relatives, I became a wife. For a month or two I was very happy. I
found my husband intelligent, with a cultivated mind, and a kind heart. We were
alone in a villa belonging to my grandfather, and proved so sufficient for
mutual happiness that I returned home with great regret. Oh, that we had never
returned!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion had been so
absorbed in the recital that she had failed to notice the increasing pallor of
the narrator. Struck with the intense sadness of the last tone, she started to
find her visitor sinking back in her chair, her lips blanched, her hands
trembling.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Throwing aside her
work, she ran to her chamber for cologne, with which she bathed the forehead
and hands of the lady, then rang for James to bring her a cup of fresh coffee.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She insisted that Mrs.
Douglass should rest before she continued her interesting story; but the lady,
with a sigh, urged,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I may never have
so favorable an opportunity to finish. My sad tale is nearly ended, and I shall
be greatly relieved when I have told my only American friend my folly and my
punishment; so resume your work, and let me end the recital as briefly as
possible.&quot;</span></p>

<h1><a id="Part_1_Chapter_19"><span class='c8'>CHAPTER XIX.</span></a></h1>

<h1><span class='c6'>TEARS OF REPENTANCE.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>I HAD only been in
Madrid a few weeks before I found that my husband was jealous, unreasonably
jealous. He was so exacting that he demanded all my attention. If I conversed
with my old acquaintances, young or old, of either sex, he made a scene. My father
remonstrated, and they came to open fight, my husband declaring that he would
have no interference with his wife. To avoid quarrelling I gave up society, and
even at my father's table became constrained in manner, scarcely daring to
speak lest I should meet the reproachful eyes of my husband fixed upon me.
Finding that even this reticence did not satisfy him, I went to the other
extreme, talked and laughed—yes, and flirted too,—with any one. This went on
for more than a year. I need not say that we were both wretched; for, strange
as it was, I still loved my husband, in memory of the few weeks of unalloyed happiness
after our marriage. I think he loved me, too, though he had greatly
changed,—grown cold and sarcastic.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I was driving
out one afternoon in company with a servant, when I met a traveller, alone and
on foot, who started at my approach, gazed fixedly in my face as we slowly
passed, and then ran after the carriage. I was in delicate health, and his
sudden reappearance greatly startled me. In his excitement he did not notice my
fright; but, speaking a few words in English, he forced me to alight and join him
at a distance. It was Henreich, my brother, my long-lost idol, shattered and
destroyed. The fiercest passions lighted his magnificent eyes. He asked for
father, and cursed both him and his own bad luck that our parents still lived.
When I hurriedly told him I was married, he was so angry he would have struck
me. He asked for money, saying, repeatedly,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'I must have
money. I will have my portion of the estate. By fair means or foul, I will have
what I want.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I could not get
away from him till I had given him my purse and every jewel I had about me, and
had promised to meet him at night in a retired part of our grounds,—I thought I
could steal away unobserved.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Perhaps I could
have done so but for the servant, who was afterwards discovered to be a spy my
husband had set upon me, who told him of the strange meeting as soon as we
returned home. He had never heard my brother's name, and must have wondered at
my conduct.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I went instantly
to my chamber, where Mr.— soon joined me, coming to the couch where I lay, and
gazing in my face with such marks of agony as I could not account for.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;At that moment
my love came upon me with all its fervor. I put up my arms and drew him down to
me, and wept on his shoulder. I kissed him repeatedly, and did not notice at
the time that my caresses were not returned. I was so exhausted by what had
passed that I fell asleep. I woke, shouting,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Henreich! O
Henreich, go away! Why did you come back?'</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Who is
Henreich?' My husband's voice was so stern, so unnatural, that it frightened
me. In one instant I realized that if I said, 'He is my brother,' he would not
believe in the existence of one of whom he had never heard. Indeed, my father
often spoke of me as his only child. If he did believe me, Henreich would be
discovered, and my father's name disgraced; for, from what I had seen, I was
sure his life had become wholly corrupt. These thoughts flashed through my mind,
as my husband stood with blanched face and eyes protruding looking into mine.
Would that I had explained all to him! I am sure love for me was struggling in
his breast with the contempt he imagined I deserved; but I did not explain. I
resolved that I would give all the money I could raise to my brother, and send
him away; that when he was out of reach I would tell my husband the whole story,
under a promise from him of secrecy.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mrs. Douglass hid her
face in her hands, unable to proceed.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Tears were trickling
down Marion's cheeks.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Perhaps I am
doing wrong to tell you all this, Miss Howard. You blame me for my want of
frankness, but not half so much as  I deserve, and you will see that I have
been terribly punished. I stole from the house at the hour I had promised to
meet my brother, with a large sum of money in my hand, and a letter in which I
told him it was the last time I would help him. I begged him to go away, and
begin a life of honesty and virtue I signed myself your affectionate sister.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;My husband was
watching, and saw me go out. He followed, heard the sound of excited voices,
saw Henreich take me in his arms, and, as he thought, strain me to his breast.
Alas! it was a ruffian who held me, while he tried to force me to yield to him
my betrothal ring, a superb diamond.  He succeeded in wrenching it from my
finger. How I regained the house I never knew. I found myself in my own room on
a couch, with my maid bending over me. I was told afterward that one swoon had
succeeded another, physicians had been summoned, and remedies administered. At
the sound of my voice mother came forward with our attending physician. Another
spasm came on. Two days later I lay hovering between life and death, and my
little babe lay beside me, the very image of Henreich as he was when I first
remembered him.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I was too sick
at first to notice the absence of my husband. I learned later that he saw me
fall in trying to reach the house, caught me in his arms, and laid me on the
couch. He summoned my own maid, who saw him seize a few papers from the drawer
and go out into the darkness. From that day to this I have never seen him. All
these years, if he has lived through them, he has believed me to be a guilty
thing, not worthy even of his contempt. All these years his child has never
heard her father's name, and he whose heart was always touched with the sorrows
of a child has never heard the sacred name of father from his child's lips. Too
late I learned to love him with an intense affection, which, if it had been
cherished earlier, would have led me to overlook faults of manner and roughness
of speech which, perhaps, after all, were put on to disguise deep feeling.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Only once in all
these long, weary years have I heard from him. Our beautiful babe was two
months old when my father received a letter, stating that a sum of money had
been placed in the hands of trustees, who were named, for the benefit of my
child, if living. He said that he considered the marriage tie broken, and that
he should never trouble me again.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;He was right:
believing of me what he did, he could not do otherwise. I honor him for it,—but
I must hurry to a close.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Henreich did not
succeed in escaping the vigilance of persons who were in search of him. He had
hoped to secure enough from me to reach a foreign land and chide justice. When
his arrest was made public, the servant who had been with me on my first
meeting Henreich confessed, with bitter tears, that she had told my husband
that which caused him to watch me on that dreadful night. She said his agony of
grief at what he called the certainty of my unfaithfulness frightened her, and
she ran away, repenting that she had told him.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Henreich's
arrest and death, though under an assumed name, threw my mother into a fever, from
which she never recovered. Two years later, father married a Spanish widow,
with several sons and daughters. The eldest son was ten years older than
Juliette, and was being educated in France and Germany. He returned to his home
when she was only a few months over fourteen, became enamoured of her beauty,
and a secret engagement took place. When I learned of it I refused my consent;
but the infatuated child followed the example of her mother, and would not
yield her own wishes. His mother agreed with me; but my father said there was
no blood relation between them, and if they would wait till she was of proper
age there was no objection.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;This
half-consent was enough for Arthur Cheriton. He took Juliette out for a drive
one day. When they returned they were man and wife. After living together a
year, he found her unformed in mind and wilful in temper. He went to England on
the plea that after obtaining a situation he would send for her.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Eugene was just
one month old when his father left home. We have never seen him since. A small
fortune from my father at his death, together with the income from the sum my
husband settled on us, has sufficed for our maintenance. It will support
Juliette and her boy in comfort; but it is for her I fear. She has many of poor
Henreich's traits, and her beauty attracts many admirers. My prayer is that
the heavy afflictions which have separated us from those we love may wean her
from earth as they have the mother; that she may find in the exercise of the
duties of a Christian life the solace nothing else can give.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;One word more
and I have done. Once a year we have heard from Arthur, whom I have always kept
advised of our place of residence. I have reason to suppose he is in America,
perhaps in New York. This was what led me to say that we might be compelled to
leave the city. Juliette has lost all her love for him, and insists that she will
never recognize the tie which binds them together. As long as I live, I shall
go with her where she goes; but I know death may claim me at any time,—and then
what will become of my child?&quot;</span></p>

<h1><span class='c6'>LETTERS FROM THE PASTOR.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;HOW true it
is,&quot; said Marion, as, after she had taken Mrs. Douglass to her home, she
was seated in her own parlor,—&quot;how true that the sins of the parents are
visited on the children! God's threatenings are as faithful as his promises. I
cannot be thankful enough that I have had a pious ancestry, and that their
prayers may be answered in blessings on their descendants. How little that
father realized that, in allowing his son and daughter the indulgence of every caprice,
they were sowing seed which would spring up to their own sorrow and shame! How
little even Mrs. Cheriton realizes that she is pursuing the same evil course
with her boy, and that from being her idol he will become her tyrant! I
promised Mrs. Douglass that I would be a friend to the youthful mother; indeed
she urged that Mr. Angus had advised her to confide her story to me, and had
been confident that I would not forsake her. I will try to keep my
promise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Angus sailed early
in June, and, except a notice in the papers of the safe arrival of the
steamship in Liverpool, no news from him had been received. Mrs. Asbury wrote
Marion that her long-promised visit would be paid the last week in the month,
and that she expected her niece to return with her to Grantbury. At the close
was the following hurried postscript:—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I have opened my
letter to add that Mr. Asbury has just received a brief communication from our
dear pastor. He is well, preached on Sunday in London, both morning and
afternoon, sent affectionate regards to all friends including you and Ethel, of
course.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion read the
message with a heightened color. Her heart rebelled against being remembered in
this general way; then, reading again, was pleased to see that this was only
her aunt's rendering of his message. She fell into a revery concerning the
absent one. &quot;He told me I was the only confidant he ever had. In aunty's
last letter she narrated exactly what he told her in regard to the triumphant
death of a friend. She has no idea that I knew his sister, nor of the painful
events of his early life. I will not betray his confidence; and yet it will be
a trial to me to keep anything of interest to myself from my dear, kind aunty.
I wonder whether he will write me, and when.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She was interrupted by
James, who brought the morning paper.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Nothing
else?&quot; she asked, in a tone of disappointment.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Nothing at
all.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Looking at her watch,
she saw there would not be time to read the news before the carriage was due.
She folded it in an abstract manner, walked to the rack to put it in, when she
saw the end of a letter protruding from a newspaper inside. As this was not the
place for letters, she took it out, and found to her surprise it was unsealed,
and—&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; she said aloud, &quot;it is postmarked
London.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Angus began by
asking,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>myself back to my

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>prosperous so far

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>and farther from

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>my little Ethel in

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>my ear, &quot;I

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>There was one person
only to whom Marion spoke of the relief which had come to the Grantbury pastor,
and this was to Mary Falkner. This young girl, in the midst of her own
suffering, never forgot to pray that God would lead him into the light. It was
Marion's precious privilege to change these prayers to praise for mercies
already bestowed.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It was during a visit
made to the Home, and when the conversation had reverted to friends in
Grantbury, that Mary inquired who was preaching there. &quot;Mother goes every
Sunday to church,&quot; she went on, &quot;and says she enjoys it. She told me
word had come across the water from the pastor, that he was safe on land the
other side.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion laughed at the
curious phraseology of the widow, and then said, &quot;Your prayers for him
have been answered, Mary. He is no longer weighed down by sad memories. I will
report to you what he told Aunt Asbury.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The cripple clasped

<h1><span class='c6'>PART II.</span></h1>

<h1><a id="Part_2_Chapter_1"><span class='c8'>CHAPTER I.</span></a></h1>

<h1><span class='c6'>GRANTBURY AND THE FIRST CHURCH.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>GRANTBURY is a
manufacturing town. It has six churches, of the different denominations. The
largest and most flourishing church was the one over which Mr. Angus was
settled as pastor. A branch of this church had gone off some years before and
had built a chapel near one of the factories, hoping to bring in many of the
employés, who were neglectful of public worship. This had not been as successful
as had been hoped; the clergyman was so poorly supported that he left, and of
late the effort of the Christian workers had been concentrated on the Sunday
school.  The usual attendance here was about one hundred.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Two years before the
commencement of our story, an unusual excitement prevailed in the town, caused
by the proposition of a few speculators to build a new railroad direct to the
principal cities east and west of them, thus connecting them with the great
thoroughfares. The capitalists who owned most of the stock in the branch
railroad which connected them three times in a day with the next town at first opposed
the new project; but Mr. Asbury, with a wider and more far-reaching view of the
results, advocated it both by public speeches and offers of money.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>As he was a large
land-owner, and the railroad would have to pass through one of his most
valuable farms, it was argued by those wishing the new road, that he must be
advocating it for the good of the public against his private interests.  So,
indeed, he was. The new road was chartered, and in time in working order. A
compromise to purchase from the owners of the branch road twelve miles which
came in their direct route satisfied all parties; so that, when, the new,
tasteful depot with the long baggage-room replaced the forlorn little station
with shed attached, there was a general burst of enthusiasm.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The two years
following this made a marvelous change in the old, quiet village. Mr. Asbury
had given a beautiful site for the new depot, on conditions which had been
complied with. The grass land belonging to his largest farm had been laid out
in squares, with a park in the centre, and sold for house lots. The buildings
put up there according to the terms of sale, must not be less than a stipulated
cost; and thus a pretty village was growing up in this part of the town.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Angus's church was
half a mile from the station, and quite near Mr. Asbury's dwelling house. The
stimulus in all branches of business had been so great since the new railroad
had been built that the main street had been widened, and set out with shade
trees at the border of the flagged sidewalks.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Nor was the prosperity
confined to the vicinity of the depot. The increased demand for vegetables,
milk, etc., from the new-comers made the land too valuable for the farmers to
cultivate grass and corn for their own use. Large fields with southern
exposures were planted with early and late vegetables and small fruits, which
found a ready sale at their own new market.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>This was the condition
of the town when Mr. Angus became the pastor of the First Church.  During the
nine months following his ordination, the church building had become so crowded
that a suggestion of enlarging by transepts had been made. It was an
old-fashioned edifice, with unnecessarily roomy slips, white walls, high
pulpit, and poor ventilation. Mr. Asbury was opposed to enlarging, but did not
consider it time to give his reasons.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>At a meeting of the
trustees directly after Mr. Angus went abroad, it was proposed that the work of
enlarging be entered upon immediately, and finished by the time of the pastor's
return. Some money was subscribed; but when the paper was passed to Mr. Asbury,
he refused to sign any thing. As a large subscription had been hoped for, this
refusal threw a damper on the undertaking; but a committee was appointed to
report in one week, and the meeting adjourned.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>During this very week
a fire broke out in carpenter's shop filled with combustible matter. The flames
carried sparks and half-burned sticks to several houses in the vicinity, and
among them to the building belonging to the First Church. The committee met,
and all the male members with them, not to report on the cost of the proposed alterations,
but to consult what was to be done in this sudden and terrible emergency.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The old sturdy farmers
were near despair, but supposed they must do something to repair the temple of
the Lord, and were thankful that the walls, being of brick, were still
standing.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Others had a plan that
a new town hall, just finished, should be hired, and public worship held there
till such time as they were able to recover from the effects of the terrible
calamity which had overtaken them.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Asbury and a few
friends belonging to the wealthy portion of the church remained silent
listeners to the views of the older brethren. At length, after an hour spent in
lamentations over the calamity, and propositions which were considered
impracticable, the moderator of the meeting remarked,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;We have talked
an hour to no purpose. Will some one make a proposition as to a place of
worship for us next Sunday?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>After a momentary
pause, Mr. Asbury quietly rose from his seat with an open paper in his hand.
There was not the least trace of excitement in his manner, as he said, &quot;I
have here a letter, which I will read. It is from the trustees of the Methodist
Episcopal Church in our town, and is addressed to me.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>A motion to accept
this friendly offer was at once passed, and then Mr. Asbury rose again and
said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I have a
proposition to make; but, first, I ask you to listen to a few facts. I have
made a careful investigation into the state of our church building, the walls
of which are still standing. It is fifty-eight years old; the beams are rotten.
It ought to be a source of gratitude that we have escaped a greater calamity by
reason of the falling in of the walls, from the cellar being unventilated. It
cannot be repaired. This is the opinion of the best experts I have been able to
obtain. I propose, then, that we sell it as it stands, to some gentlemen who
offer five thousand dollars for the site. They intend, if they obtain it, to
put up a large hotel.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It's a good
offer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Take it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I object.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;We must have the
land to build again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;We need a hotel
for summer residents.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;We can worship
in the town hall.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Or disband
altogether,&quot; grumbled a man who never contributed a penny.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Altogether the clamor
following this proposition prevented any further remarks from Mr. Asbury, if he
had wished to make any, and he sat down with a smile on his face.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Several groups were at
once formed, and loud, excited voices were heard discussing this unexpected
proposal; some were for accepting, others positively refused to quit the old
spot dedicated by their fathers to the worship of God. At length the moderator,
with a loud rap on the table, called the meeting to order, and inquired whether
any gentleman had anything further to say before the proposal was put to vote.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Asbury rose again,
this time with a little flush on his face, as he remarked, &quot;I am not in
the habit, as you, my friends, are aware, of speaking of myself; but I would
like to say that I have the welfare of this parish greatly at heart. We are
blessed with a good pastor,—a live, working man. I believe he will be more
useful in the future than he has been in the past; that he is a growing man. I
believe that he will return to us with greatly improved health and spirits, and
enter on his work again with new hope and confidence of success. I want to show
him that we appreciate him by building him a new church large enough to
accommodate all the new families who wish to join us. When a proposition was
made at our last meeting to enlarge our old building, I did not subscribe,
because I knew the work would cost more in the end than to begin a new one. I
have had some sad experience, as many of you know&quot; (smiling), &quot;as to
the cost of repairing old buildings. Now that the fire has rendered that undertaking
impracticable, I propose to your board of trustees to accept a lot of land on
the rising ground, half-way between this and the new depot, which I freely
tender to them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Shouts of
&quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;We will,&quot; etc., were checked by a wave of Mr.
Asbury's hand, as he added,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Wait a little: I
have not done yet; there are conditions. I wish to say that a subscription
paper has already been started for a new edifice costing not less than twenty
thousand dollars, and the sum of fourteen thousand eight hundred dollars,
including five thousand for our old church building, already subscribed, on
condition that the whole amount be raised, and no mortgage ever be allowed upon
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Profound silence
followed this speech, which was like a bombshell thrown into an unprotected
house; then a few whispers were heard,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Five thousand
and more to raise. Where will it come from?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'T would have
cost ten to repair, and 't would have been an old building after all.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>At last, Mr. Rand, an
aged, white-haired farmer, stood up.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'm an old
man,&quot; he said, &quot;and not long for this world; but I hope to live to
see the new church built on that 'ere spot yonder, which, in my opinion, is the
pootiest place for a church in the hull town,—yes, and to worship God in it,
too. I'm not rich, and I'm not poor. I've got nigh upon two thousand dollars in
the savings bank, laid up for a wet day. My children are all married and
settled on farms of their own; so I sha'n't do any of 'em wrong if I add my
name to Mr. Asbury's paper,&quot; holding out his hand for it.
&quot;There,&quot; he said, deliberately taking off the glasses he had put on
to write,—&quot;there's fifteen thousand three hundred subscribed on the
above-named conditions. If necessary, I'll add another five hundred; and I'm
sure my old woman will say so, too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;After this noble
example,&quot; rejoined the moderator, more moved by the old man's words than
he liked to show, &quot;I'll put down my name for the same sum as he did.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Smaller sums were at
once added, so that when the meeting adjourned, after the appointment of a
building committee, only one thousand more was necessary to make up the entire
amount. This was to be obtained by personal solicitation from the families of
those not represented at the meeting, and a committee of ladies was requested
to take this work in hand.</span></p>

<h1><span class='c6'>VISIT TO INGLESIDE.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>THE architect employed
by the building committee had submitted a plan for the new church,—Gothic, high
spire, and stained-glass windows. It was accepted, the foundation laid, the
walls, which were to be of native stone, raised to the height of seven feet,
when a letter was received from Mr. Angus, enclosing a slip cut from a London newspaper.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;A very
innocent-looking paragraph,&quot; exclaimed Mr. Asbury to his wife. &quot;But
what a stir it will make in the parish!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It was the
announcement of an urgent call given to the Rev. Harold Angus, of New York
City, United States of America, to settle over the —Church, —Street, London, at
a salary of one thousand pounds.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In addition to the
printed paragraph, Mr. Angus had written,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>DEAR FRIENDS,—</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Mail going out.
Only time to say that the call alluded to, and the</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>enclosed slip, in
which it was announced, came to hand by</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>the same mail, and
was wholly unexpected. Fearing you might see it</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>copied into a New
York paper, I forward it, and will write more at</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>length by next

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>H. ANGUS.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Before the close of
the day in which the letter was received, few belonging to the First Church
were ignorant of its contents. Mr. Asbury was right. The news created a great
excitement, not only in their own parish, but throughout the town. A meeting of
the voters in the First Church was called to express their opinions in regard
to the subject of the paragraph.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>After the opening
exercises, Mr. Asbury stated the object of the meeting.  Mr. Rand then started
to his feet, and with a quick glance around the room, said, in a loud voice,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'm as deaf as a
post, from a cold I got down on my medder, and I can't hear a word you say; but
my wife, she's heerd that some folks 't other side of the water are trying to
get our pastor away from us, and she told me to come here and vote it right down.
It's a shame, anyway, for Christians to be a-pulling and a-tearing of one
another. We've got the first right to Mr. Angus, and I vote that we hold on to
him, and let them get a minister nearer home. That's all I've got to say. If
it's more salary than we pay him, I guess I can help make up the difference
between what they'll give and what we do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>A hearty laugh
followed this speech, and, as Mr. Rand had expressed in brief the wishes of all
present, the meeting soon adjourned, after a unanimous vote &quot;to hold on to
their pastor,&quot; and make the question of salary satisfactory to him.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>One of his neighbors
having screamed this result into Mr. Rand's ear, he mounted his farm-wagon with
a significant nod of his head.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;All right!&quot;
he shouted, at the top of his voice. &quot;I darsn't go home till I knew the
parish would hold on to him. My old woman would—you know.&quot; His voice was
lost in the distance.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Perhaps if the good
farmer had known the contents of a letter which at this very hour was being
carried by wind and steam across the Atlantic he would have been still more
jubilant as he sat eating his supper of cold corned beef and greens, and
telling his wife, between the mouthfuls, the news he had learned at the
meeting.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mrs. Asbury made her
visit to Marion at the time she had promised, taking Ethel with her. Of course
all the Grantbury news was rehearsed, in the course of which the pastor's name
was frequently mentioned.  Ethel, meanwhile, had succeeded in coaxing Gypsy, a
pet spaniel belonging to Mrs. Mitchell, to allow herself to be dressed in one
of her dolly's cloaks.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Now,&quot; she
said, &quot;we are going to sail on a voyage to Europe, to see Mr. Angus. You
must sit very still, doggy, because it's Sunday. I shall teach you a hymn by
and by,&quot;—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'I must not play on
Sunday.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;When we get to
Europe, I shall let you go with me to Ingleside, you know. There is a pretty
garden at Ingleside, with an arbor all covered with grape vines. If you are
good till we get there,—sit still, Gypsy,—oh, how naughty you are to pull off
your nice cloak!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>By this time Gypsy
thought she ought to be released, and jumped from the sofa, where Ethel had
placed her, at which the little girl burst into a merry laugh.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What is she
talking about?&quot; asked Marion, in a low tone.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Where is
Ingleside, Ethel?&quot; inquired her mother.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Why, don't you
know? It is Mr. Angus's home, where his grandfather used to live.  When he was
a little boy, his mamma let him go there sometimes; and he had hens and little
goats to play with. We talk about it when we are taking a walk, you know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What a pretty
name Ingleside is,&quot; remarked Marion, without raising her eyes from her
work. She was making a fine dress for Frances, Ethel's favorite doll, and of
course the excitement of this was what made her cheeks look so rosy.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>During Ethel's visits
Marion invited Geenie Cheriton to take a drive with them and pass the rest of
the day with the little girl. They all gave a sigh of relief, however, when
James started with him for his home, and Mrs. Asbury said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I wonder how
Mrs. Douglass can endure that child's noise. It is such a pity that he should
be ruined by indulgence.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I wouldn't be
that boy's nurse for a fortune,&quot; exclaimed Hepsey, who was putting up the
toys Geenie had pulled about. &quot;They'll have a time with him if he
lives.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Lambert called
during Mrs. Asbury's visit, and was introduced to the guests. He seemed greatly
attracted by Ethel, who fixed her large violet eyes seriously upon him. He
succeeded at last in coaxing her to his side, when they had quite an animated
conversation. Before they parted he gave her a beautiful little charm, whist he
unhooked from his watch-chain.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>This was the first
time Marion had seen him since her discovery that Mr. Regy, of whom she had
heard so much, was only the double of her old friend. She longed to ask him
about it, but would not before strangers. She contented herself with inquiries
about Neddy Carter, who was soon to be admitted to the mission school.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Only two days after
Mrs. Asbury's return to Grantbury, Marion received a thick letter with a
foreign postmark,—Leyden, Yorkshire. She retired quickly to her own chamber,
and sat down with blooming cheeks to its perusal.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>I have no intention of
copying the letter, but will say that, after giving her an account of his visit
to his home,—a visit which almost overwhelmed him with its painful
memories,—and visiting the graves of father, mother, and brother as they lay
side by side under the old yew-trees, he took the cars for Ingleside, his
father's ancestral home in Leyden. He told her he found only an old servant, a
retainer of the family, who received him as one from the dead. His grandfather
had four children born here,—one son and three daughters. When he died, in
Harold's twelfth year, his property was divided equally between them, except
Ingleside, which was always to be kept in the family, and after the death of
his daughters to revert to his oldest grandson.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Estelle Angus, for
whom Stella was named, made a will and left her namesake her heir. Mary and
Sarah died without making a will, and the property came to Harold, as the
nearest of kin. It was not a great fortune that he found awaiting him, Mr.
Angus told Marion, but, with the money left in the bank by his father, it was
sufficient to enable him to carry out some cherished plans.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>One of these plans was
to build a pretty home on a certain knoll in Grantbury (the very one Mr. Asbury
had given to the church), to be called Ingleside; but there was one word from
her which must come before the new Ingleside could be built.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Then followed certain
statements in regard to a diagnosis recently made of his heart, which conveyed
to the young lady a pretty accurate idea of what the word must be, in order
that the English cottage be erected.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>By this time Marion,
by certain unwelcome symptoms, which had forced themselves on her notice was
aware of the strength of her own attachment for her pastor, and, being
naturally frank and outspoken, she wrote the word (a very short one), which,
could he have known it, would have set good Farmer Rand's mind at rest in
regard &quot;to holding on&quot; to his pastor.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In a note added to his
letter, immediately following the receipt of the call from the London church,
Mr. Angus added:—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;I have just
forwarded to Mr. Asbury an invitation to settle in our</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>great metropolis.
Would you prefer to live in England? Of course I</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>could not give the
parish an idea of what my answer will be till</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>I hear from you. Am
I presumptuous? You first taught me to be</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>hopeful. Am I too
daring to hope now?&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Early one morning soon
after this, Mrs. Douglass sent Marion a note, requesting her to call at her
earliest convenience.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>On entering the house
where Mrs. Douglass had rooms, Marion met in the hall a dashing young man,
dressed in the height of the fashion, with a lighted cigar in his hand. She
would have passed him without notice, but for a bold stare, which sent the
indignant blood to her cheeks.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The knock at Mrs.
Douglass's door was for a minute unanswered; then Mrs. Cheriton opened it, her
eyes still flashing defiance, her head thrown back, but looking more
brilliantly beautiful than the visitor had ever seen her.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mrs. Douglass had
evidently been under some strong excitement: her eyes were red with crying, and
her hands trembled.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Eugene came forward
with a rush to meet the lady. He was dressed for a walk and insisted that
Marion should accompany him.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I am on my way
to my music scholars,&quot; explained the visitor, taking the little fellow in
her arms. &quot;Some time you shall go with me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'm going to
walk with you,&quot; said his mother haughtily.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;How can I aid
you, dear friend?&quot; asked Marion, when the outer door had shut upon the
others.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Did you meet a
gentleman as you came in?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I did. I can guess
that he is Mr. Cheriton.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh, no! no!
Would that he were here. Juliette is so young: she does not consider; she is—I
am pained to say so—she is imprudent. Arthur has no right to leave her
unprotected. She wrung her hands in great distress, her eyes full of tears.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Who is he?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;His name is
Alford. Juliette accompanied one of our fellow-boarders to the theatre, and was
introduced to him there. He has been here every day since. She has just
promised, in my presence, and contrary to my wishes, to go to the theatre with
him to-night. I am powerless to prevent it. What must I, what can I do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Alford,&quot;
repeated Marion. &quot;Do you know his Christian name?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;There is his
card,—C. W. Alford, New York City.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;A very
indefinite address. Will you let me take it? I will make inquiries concerning
his character. I am sorry to say I was not favorably impressed with his
appearance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;But Juliette has
a husband. Whatever his moral character may be, she must not receive attentions
from him. If the poor child has a father living—&quot;  A burst of tears
interrupted her.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;She has a
heavenly Father,&quot; urged Marion, deeply moved. &quot;He will never lose
sight of her for a moment. His eye sees her when no earthly eye can follow her,
and His arm can protect her from harm. Dear Mrs. Douglass, don't weep so. Let
us ask His guidance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Seldom had the young
Christian poured forth such earnest petitions for help as now.  Realizing, as
she did, the impulsive passion of the young wife, the excuses she would make to
her conscience,—that her husband had forsaken her,—the impossibility of earthly
effort to restrain her, Marion called upon God to appear for them in their trouble,
to touch the heart of the young mother, to put barriers in her path to ruin, to
fill her soul with purer joys.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Feeling as she did at
that moment, perhaps as never before, how sheltered and protected her own life
had been, how brightly the future was opening before her own path, her tears
gushed forth afresh at the thought of the dangers threatening this beautiful,
unprotected child-wife. She prayed too that the absent husband might be brought
to a sense of his wrong-doing in forsaking her whom he had sworn to cherish,
and return to them with new purposes and new resolves. Nor did she forget the
absent father, so long unknown to those connected with him by the closest ties.
She prayed that if he were still an inhabitant of earth, God, who knew all
things, would lead him back to them, to be their comfort and joy.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;O Miss
Howard!&quot; cried the afflicted mother, clasping her hands, &quot;what a
blessing that we can go to our heavenly Father and tell him all our sorrows! I
have an assurance that He will answer; that He will in some way protect my
dear, deluded child. It may be by my death. I would willingly give up my life,
could I be assured of her safety. It may be that He will touch Arthur's heart,
and bring him home to his family. I would submit to any privation, any inconvenience,
to have him, her lawful protector, with her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Or,&quot; added
Marion, &quot;He may restore to you the husband you have so long mourned. A
father would be a great blessing to Juliette now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;A Christian
father,&quot; murmured the lady, raising her eyes to heaven. &quot;Every day my
prayer for him is, Lord, if he is living, lead him to Thyself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>After a short silence,
the lady added, &quot;I thank God I can say with truth that, since the hour my
husband left me, believing I was lost to virtue, I have always maintained the
strictest reserve toward all of the opposite sex. I was young, and often called
handsome. I believe my husband had been proud of my beauty. I could play the piano
and guitar as an accompaniment to my voice; but I only played for my parents
and most intimate friends. I have always tried to impress upon Juliette, both
by example and precept, that a wife so unfortunately situated must be doubly
guarded in her conduct. Character is a plant which must be kept in good soil,
free from blights and mildew. It must be watched and tended with care. It is too
sacred to be trifled with.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mrs. Douglass wept as
she talked, and Marion, desirous of soothing her, said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Mrs. Cheriton's
love for Eugene is a great preservative.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, that is
true,&quot; sighing. &quot;Poor boy! He needs a father's restraining
hand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;We have asked
our heavenly Father to preserve them both from all evil, and I believe He
will,&quot; rejoined the visitor, hopefully.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>God did answer the
prayers so earnestly offered, but in a way entirely unlooked for.</span></p>

<h1><span class='c6'>WITHOUT CHRIST.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>MRS. CHERITON did not
return from her walk for an hour after Marion left.  She came in looking so
brilliantly beautiful that it made her mother's heart ache.  Her eyes always
shone like stars, and the rich color crimsoned her cheeks when she was excited
either by joy or anger. Eugene, too, seemed overflowing with spirits. His hands
were full of toys and sweetmeats, given him, he said, by the nice gentleman.
When he threw off his cap, his grandmother noticed that his hair was wet with
perspiration, and told her daughter he ought not to sit in the draught; but she
retorted with some indifferent reply. Finding she could not induce the child to
move, nor to give up the colored candies he was eagerly devouring, with a sigh
the grandmother left the room.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>During the rest of the
day, the young mother went about with a smile on her lips, quite absorbed in
thoughts of a pleasant nature. Toward night her boy coughed two or three times;
but she, usually so ready to take alarm, laughed at her mother's suggestion
that he must have taken cold.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>At an early hour Mr.
Alford called to accompany her to the theatre, and poured out such a torrent of
flattery at her beauty as quite turned her head.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Scarcely bidding her
mother good by, she went gayly down the stairs, little imagining what her
return would be.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The clock was just
striking twelve when, in turning the corner of the street, the house she called
home came into view. At this hour it was usually dark. Now the hall and her
mother's room were brilliantly lighted. Just at this moment a carriage dashed
up to the door.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What does it
mean?&quot; she cried, in a startled voice, trying to pull her hand from her
companion's arm.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;When can I see
you again?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The insinuating tone
was lost on her, for with a sudden fear she had released herself and flown
away. Bounding up the stairs, she stopped one instant to gaze into the lighted
room. On her mother's lap lay Geenie, struggling for breath. Before them stood
the doctor, with a spoonful of medicine in his hand,—just brought by his
servant,—which he was vainly trying to force down the child's throat. One of the
servants was bringing through another door a foot-tub filled with boiling
water, while another was pulling the blanket from the bed.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>All this the mother
took in at one glance, then sprang forward with a loud shriek and threw herself
on her knees before her boy.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Mamma, help
Geenie! Make the bad man go away! Geenie can't breathe!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It's the
croup,&quot; gasped her mother, in reply to her agonized gaze into the child's
face, darkened and convulsed with this struggle for breath.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It is a case of
life and death,&quot; added the physician, in a solemn voice.  &quot;If you
love your brother, persuade him to take this medicine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;My brother! He's
my boy, my own, my precious child!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Her voice rose to a
shriek, as she saw that his features became more convulsed. She cried, she
wrung her hands, calling continually, &quot;Eugene, my pet, my darling! I won't
give you up! You sha'n't die!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;He will die, and
very soon, if you do not control yourself. You must be calm.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Addressing one of the
servants, who had just returned with the prescription, he ordered Eugene's head
to be held, while he forced down the medicine. Then turning to Mrs. Douglass,
he said, &quot;Madam, will you try to bring your daughter to reason? Every
moment of delay makes the boy's situation more dangerous. With the aid of the servants,
I wish to use the steam.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He really pitied the
child-mother, as he saw her fixed gaze in her son's convulsed face; but he knew
that unless vigorous measures were used, a short time would end the struggle.
Taking Eugene in his own arms, he directed the girl to wrap the boy in the
large blanket and hold him over the boiling water. The other girl was to
furnish a fresh supply.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mrs. Douglass tried to
persuade her daughter to leave the room; but she would not. She sank into a
chair and watched every movement which took place. She seemed suddenly to be
turned into an automaton, only that those wondrous eyes flashed so continuously
they seemed to light up the room.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In half an hour the
medicine began to take effect, the terrible sound, never to be forgotten, grew
less harsh. The doctor, with his coat off, worked like a hero. It was evident
that the steam produced relief in breathing. More and more heavily drooped the
child's head, his eyelids closed, the terrible heaving of his breast was more natural.
The doctor put his hand under the blanket, found the pulse, and nodded
approval.  Without awakening the boy, he put a small powder on his tongue and
sat down to watch.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Another hour passed.
Mrs. Douglass had quietly retired to the next room. Eugene slept still. He had
been removed to the sofa. The doctor still waited. The struggle for life had
been so great, he did not like to leave his patient till assured that he would
have no return of the frightful convulsions. He was a father too, and aside
from his desire as a physician to control the disease, he was interested in the
unusual circumstances of the patient. At home, he had a daughter growing up,
now in her seventeenth year, who looked more fit to be a mother than this passionate
girl, who at one moment gave free vent to her frenzied agony, and the next
controlled herself so wonderfully that she had sat for hours scarcely daring to
breathe.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He could not
comprehend, skilled as he was in controlling disease, the torture which that
poor girl was undergoing from an accusing conscience.  She saw herself at last
as in a mirror,—wilful, proud of her outward charms, undutiful to her
long-suffering, self-sacrificing mother,—her best friend,—idolizing her boy, but
blind to his faults, and not restraining her own temper that she might teach
him self-control. Then her thoughts reverted to her absent husband, and
conscience, resolved to be heard at last, set before her a catalogue of her
offences toward him,—wilful neglect of his wishes, too evident want of
affection, etc., which had at last weaned him from her and sent him far away.
&quot;Where is he now?&quot; It seemed to her that this question was screamed
in her ears. &quot;You drove him wild with your taunts and neglect.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>At length she remembered
the events of the previous night.  How long ago that seemed!  The whispers of
flattery that had sounded so sweetly in her ears, how she loathed them now! How
she loathed herself, that they could have pleased her! She seemed to herself to
have been suddenly snatched away from the very brink of a precipice, and to be
frantically seizing some sure support which would prevent her from falling back
into the dreadful abyss. Oh, how dark it looked! And yet how eagerly only last
night she had rushed toward it!</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh, my boy! my
boy! If you die your mother is justly punished.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mrs. Cheriton had not
lived nineteen years with her mother without understanding that this dearest
friend was of late governed by different principles from those which controlled
her in earlier life. She acknowledged in this dark hour that when all other
help had failed, the poor widow, bearing alone her heavy burden of grief and self-reproach,
had found comfort and solace in the truths contained in the sacred book
hitherto so little prized. God was no longer to her an angry judge, but a
tender, loving father, whose heart yearned over her. Jesus Christ was her
sympathizing Saviour, who had voluntarily come to earth, suffered poverty,
temptation, and ignominy, that he might know how to succor his children in like
sorrow.  Many, many times Mrs. Douglass had endeavored to impress these blessed
teachings on her daughter; but they only seemed to her like idle tales. Of
late, since her acquaintance with Marion Howard, she had been urged to trust in
the kind care of One whose eye of love was always watching her; but these
faithful words, instead of drawing her heart toward the friend who uttered
them, had led her to treat Marion with cold contempt.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>As is frequently the
case with persons in the near prospect of death, the events of the past life
flash like lightning through the mind, so in Juliette's agony, circumstances
connected with her childhood, youth, and brief married life rushed to her
memory with a force and vividness which well nigh overwhelmed her. As she
afterward described it, &quot;I seemed to be living my life over again: I was
wooed and won. I tasted the purest joy of all when my child was placed in my
arms. I sinned and was punished. I went on sinning and repenting. I went headlong
into the arms of a destroyer, when a hand was stretched out and saved me. I can
never make myself believe that all this occurred in only five hours.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>At last the physician,
who had for some time been dozing in his chair, rose quietly, and, coming
toward the rigid figure, said, encouragingly,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;He is sleeping
quietly now. Be careful that he does not get a chill. I will be in again at
nine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She gazed in his face,
scarcely understanding his words, looking so bewildered that he mechanically
placed his fingers on her pulse. Her hand was like ice.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;He, your child,
is better. I am quite hopeful now. You have controlled yourself
admirably.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Do you mean that
he will not die? That God will not punish me by taking him away?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, my poor
child. I mean that I hope God in mercy intends to spare him to you. He is given
to you afresh, to train up to a good and useful life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>What a change came
over that young face, on which despair had been stamped! The hard eyes
softened, the lips quivered, the crimson tide came rushing back, painting
cheeks and brow; the whole countenance grew luminous, as with quickened breath
the child-mother clasped her hands, exclaiming,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh, how I will
love Him! He is so good, and I have been so bad.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Forgetful of the
physician's presence, or of anything, except that the God, whom she had not
loved, had dealt with her in such infinite mercy, she fell on her knees and
buried her face in her hands.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Lord, help me!
Save me!&quot; she cried. &quot;I have tried living without Thy help. I was all
but lost. Do help, dear Lord.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>These words, so
different from what he expected under the circumstances, seemed too sacred for
a stranger's ears, and the kind physician silently took his leave, wiping his
eyes as he went down the stairs, then walked quickly to his home in the gray
dawn of a new day.</span></p>

<h1><span class='c6'>WITH CHRIST.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>MRS. CHERITON'S trials
had only begun.  Eugene's croup was followed by congestion of the lungs, the
attack assuming from the first alarming symptoms. He would not bear his mother
out of his sight for a moment. Indeed the result of her injudicious fondness
showed itself during these sad weeks in a manner which would have been a
warning to any one.  Though she deprived herself of sleep, and almost of food,
in order to be always at hand to minister to his wants, he showed no gratitude.
He exacted everything as a right, and, if there was the slightest opposition to
his wishes, he screamed with passion, often exclaiming, &quot;I hate you.  Go
away, bad mamma.&quot; He would not take medicine from her, shrieking,
&quot;You tell lies. You told me it was good and it wasn't. I'll let Miss
Howard give it to me: she never tells lies.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>From Marion, too, he
would submit to any treatment, even to the blisters upon his chest. &quot;It
will hurt you, Geenie,&quot; she said, &quot;but if you don't have it on for a
few minutes that dreadful pain will come back. Be a good boy, and I will tell
you a nice story about Gypsy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Will you bring
Gypsy to see me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, I
will.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In addition to
Eugene's sickness, the doctor's services were in daily requisition for Mrs.
Douglass, who had never risen from her bed since the night of her grandson's
seizure. The agony of mind she had suffered on account of her daughter,
followed so speedily by Eugene's dangerous illness, proved too much for a frame
enfeebled by disease. Violent pain in the head was succeeded by nervous chills,
until Dr. Danforth became alarmed for her life.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Under these
circumstances Marion proved her real friendship by spending as much time as
possible with the patient sufferer, and thus was at hand when poor Juliette,
driven to her wits' end by the insubordination of her darling, was unable to
control him.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>As the young mother
had not spoken of the events of that never-to-be-forgotten night, neither Mrs.
Douglass nor Marion could account for the entire change in her manners and
appearance. They supposed her fright at the sudden illness of her boy had for
the time driven all other thoughts from her mind. Indeed, Mrs. Douglass, with
many tears, thanked God that in his wonder-working providence he had taken any
means to prevent a career of gayety which must have ended in her ruin. It would
have been an immense relief to her could she have known that a card with the
name &quot;C. W. Alford&quot; had been sent to her daughter the day following
Eugene's attack, that the question written with pencil underneath his name,
&quot;When can I see you?&quot; had been hastily answered with one word,
&quot;Never.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Yes, her Father in
heaven, more ready to grant our requests than we are to ask them, had indeed
answered the Christian mother's prayers, though as yet she knew it not.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Through all these
anxious, weary days and nights, in the midst of  her duties,—and they were
onerous,—Mrs. Cheriton was supported by the thought, &quot;God will help me: he
has promised to help those who ask him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In after-days she used
to say, &quot;I seemed to be living in a dream. Whenever the thought of Mr.
Alford came into my mind, or the recollection of his vague suggestions recurred
to me, I shivered, while my cheeks burned like fire. Then the conduct of
Geenie, ungovernable and unloving, continually reminded me of another precipice
from which I had been drawn back.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;On the other
hand, I wondered at myself, at the sweet peace which at times filled my soul.
How good God has been to me! How kind, how loving, how tender! Sometimes when
Geenie slept I found time to read a few verses in the Bible. I found verses
written expressly for me: 'Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord
pitieth them that fear him.'  'For he knoweth our frame, he remembereth that we
are dust.' I could scarcely believe that these precious words were in God's own
book. I put in a mark and read them again and again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>But it was impossible
for such a radical change to take place in Mrs. Cheriton without the fact
becoming visible to those about her. Even before her mother noticed anything,
the servants talked about it.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;She must believe
he is going to die,&quot; one girl said to another, &quot;else she wouldn't
speak so kindly, and thank me as she does.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The first thing
indicating a change noticed by her mother was one morning, when the
chamber-girl, having put everything in order, had left the room, Juliette came
from the adjoining chamber with a smile on her face. Approaching the bed, she
kissed her mother, saying, softly,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Geenie is
asleep. If you like, I'll read to you,&quot; laying her hand on the Bible as
she spoke.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Thank you, dear.
That would indeed be a pleasure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Where shall I
read? But here is your mark in St. John's Gospel.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In a low, and, to her
mother, inexpressibly sweet voice, she read the last words of Christ to his
disciples, frequently pausing as she read, as though applying the precious
words to her own case.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mrs. Douglass lay with
her eyes fixed on the pale countenance of the reader, wondering what made her
so beautiful. The rich bloom had gone, the dark eyes no longer flashed; but
never had there been such a serene smile wreathing the lips.  It seemed to
indicate an inward peace.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>At last, Juliette,
raising her eyes from the book met her mother's gaze fixed intently on her.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Can I do
anything more for you, dear?&quot; she said, rising and leaning over the bed.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;O Juliette! If
you could, if you would, pray: we need help so much.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>There was a momentary
struggle in the breast of the young convert, and then, throwing herself on her
knees by the bed, she hid her face in her hands and poured out from a thankful
heart prayer for Christ's presence, such as he had promised his disciples, and
praise for the blessed hope of acceptance and pardon. With the simplicity of a
child who has scarcely learned the language of prayer, but whose soul is fully
alive to the value of the blessings to be asked for, she plead for wisdom equal
to every emergency, grace for every trial her Father in his love might see fit
to send. She prayed for her dear mother, so weak and suffering, for her boy,
not yet out of danger, that He who loved them better than any earthly love
would do for them according to his will.  &quot;But, oh, dear Jesus, who loves little
children,&quot; she cried, clasping her hands, &quot;if he must die, and it is Thy
blessed will, prepare my boy, my poor, neglected child, for heaven. Let him not
suffer eternally for his mother's sinful neglect of Thy commands.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Then her sobs became
so violent that she was obliged to rise hastily and leave the room.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mrs. Douglass closed
her eyes, while she murmured the inspired words, &quot;Lord, now let Thy
servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I asked God, and
He has heard my prayers. She has learned to pray. That was not her first
prayer. O my Saviour, help me to thank Thee as I ought.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>When Dr. Danforth made
his next visit, he found Mrs. Douglass bolstered up in bed, Hepsey, who had for
a day or two supplied Marion's place, arranging her still abundant hair. They
were engaged in animated conversation when he entered. He had become deeply interested
in the strangers, having never forgotten the scenes of the night of his
introduction to them. To no one had he ever mentioned the young mother's
prayer, the burden of which was help for herself from some great danger, not
for relief and returning health to her child.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You are
better,&quot; he said, cheerfully, after having counted her pulse.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, Doctor, I
have had a restorative.&quot; </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Wine? I wish you
had taken it sooner.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;No, Doctor. I
have heard my daughter pray.&quot; The mother's face beamed with joy.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What is so great
a beautifier as happiness?&quot; was the doctor's thought. &quot;She looks ten
years younger.&quot; He spoke seriously, but with the greatest tenderness,
saying,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I have heard her
pray, and I think her prayers have been answered. She has borne the trials of
these sad weeks with a sweet submission and patience I have seldom seen
surpassed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;God has given
her grace according to her day.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes. He has
indeed fulfilled His promise to the widow and orphan.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;My daughter is
not a widow, Doctor,&quot; murmured the patient, her cheeks flushing. &quot;You
have been such a kind friend, I may confide so much of our story to you.
Juliette was married at the early age of fourteen, and her child was born
within the year. Geenie was only a few weeks old when his father left home for
England, ostensibly to obtain a situation where he might support his family in
the luxuries to which they had been accustomed. We hear from him occasionally,
but have never seen him since.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Unnatural
monster!&quot; cried the doctor, indignantly. He thought of his own little
girl, and wondered how she would endure such a living trial,—she to whom the
loss of a pet dog had been the greatest grief she had known.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It was a minute or two
before he could rally sufficiently to remark, &quot;Eugene is better too. I am
sorry to say my patient will soon be dismissing me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;We have so few
friends in America, we cannot give up your visits without regret, Doctor. But
it is selfish for us to keep you longer than is necessary, when so many need
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Is a physician
to have no friends, then?&quot; queried the doctor, assuming a gruff voice.
&quot;You will find it hard, madam, to get rid of me.&quot;  Then, with an
emphatic shrug of his shoulders, he went away, and drove nearly a mile out of
his course, while he was wondering what kind of a man Mr. Cheriton could be who
would forsake a wife like Juliette.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In another respect the
young mother showed that she had taken God's word as the rule of her life. This
was in the management of her child. Formerly, when herself provoked at his
rudeness or impatient at his exactions, she had dealt him a sudden blow, which,
however, always seemed to rouse his combativeness to such a degree that it required
much skill to soothe him. She usually had to buy him off from the exhibition of
temper by confectionery or some new toys. Now, feeling her own weakness, she
daily sought strength from God. She had noticed, too, how easily Mr. Angus and
Marion had made him obey, not by blows or threats, but by a firm and gentle
kindness, which won his confidence. It was her aim to imitate this method.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>As soon as he was able
to sit up, Eugene felt rather than understood that his mother would no longer
submit to be struck in the face or called &quot;bad mamma&quot; when his wishes
were crossed. She talked to him, explained that he must obey, that Jesus Christ
loved good children, and that she would teach him to pray, and ask this best Friend
to help him be good.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>There is a sacredness
in religious teachings which always arrests the attention of a child. No
stories are so much delighted in as the stories of Joseph and Samuel and
Daniel, and particularly the story of our dear Saviour. Over and over again these
stories may be repeated; yet the little one never tires, but will ask new
questions concerning the wonderful characters.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Juliette had thus a
double incentive to read her Bible. She wished to find in the sacred pages
strength for daily duties; and she also read for the instruction of her boy.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion came in one day
and found Geenie dressed in a wrapper, sitting in his mother's lap. In her hand
she held the Good Book, and they were talking eagerly of the story she had
read.  Marion wrote afterwards, in her letter to Mr. Angus, that she seldom had
seen a prettier picture,—the beauty of both so softened by the subjects on
which they were talking.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion bent over and
pressed her lips to the fair forehead of the young mother, and Eugene made them
laugh by imitating her example.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;She's nicer than
she was,&quot; he exclaimed, patting her cheek. &quot;She doesn't tell lies any
more. She tells me when the medicine is going to taste badly,—but I take it all
the same.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>After talking for a
few minutes with Mrs. Douglass, Marion hurried away, saying to herself,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What a glorious
change! What a purifier and refiner Christianity is! How Mr. Angus will rejoice
that Juliette has accepted her Saviour!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Before I close this
chapter I must tell the reader that Marion showed Mr. Alford's card to Mr.
Lambert the very day Mrs. Douglass had given it to her, only asking whether he
knew the man. He did not, but soon found a man of his description was a
frequenter of gambling-saloons and other disreputable places of resort, that
the name Alford was one of several aliases, and that he was a man wholly unfit
to be trusted.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>To neither Mrs.
Douglass nor her daughter did she repeat this information, the change in
Juliette rendering it unnecessary.</span></p>

<h1><a id="Part_2_Chapter_5"><span class='c8'>CHAPTER V.</span></a></h1>

<h1><span class='c6'>HOME IN THE STABLE LOFT.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;THIS is only a
stable, Miss Marion.&quot; </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;The place must
be here, Hepsey: the number three hundred and sixty is plainly marked.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The young lady
reverted to her paper again.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Esther Cole,
three hundred sixty.' Three hundred fifty-eight, the last house is marked. I
must inquire.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>One of the hostlers
came forward to the door of the stable.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Do you want a
carriage, lady?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I am looking for
a number which ought to be here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Is it a tenement
house you're after, ma'am?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, and a
family by the name of Cole.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It's aloft their
house is. Walk right through ma'am, to the ladder beyont.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Thank you,&quot;
replied Marion, giving him a smile which quite won him. &quot;How very clear
your floor is! I was never in a stable before.  Look, Hepsey! See how nicely
the carriages are covered; and really there is quite a pretty parlor,—and such
a row of whips hanging up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;That room is for
ladies and gentlemen to wait while their horses are harnessed, ma'am.&quot; The
hostler was doing the honors in his best style. They had now reached the
ladder, as he called it by which they were to ascend to the room
&quot;aloft,&quot; and he said, &quot;It's a poor place, ma'am, for a lady the
likes of yees.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It's a
heathenish place,&quot; retorted Hepsey &quot;Not fit for Christians to live
in. Are you sure, young man, that the steps are safe?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He laughed merrily,
exhibiting a row of even white teeth.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;If it's afraid
ye are, ma'am,&quot; he explained, looking at Marion, &quot;sure I'll bring 'em
all down to yees,—every mother's son of 'em.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh, no, indeed!
We will go up. Many thanks for your courtesy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Her face was all
dimpled with smiles as she prepared to mount the steps, while the hostler
walked away, saying to himself,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;A rale lady that
is. The man that owns her must be a happy one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>At the top of the
steps a door opened into a large room rudely partitioned off from the hayloft
and smelling strongly of the fumes from the stable below. Seven people called
this room their home,—father, mother, grandmother, and four children of
different ages under eight years. Unlike many who live in more spacious
apartments, their hearts were larger than their home, and they had recently welcomed
a poor waif thrown upon the cold charities of the world.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Esther Sims was an
orphan who had been connected with the mission Sunday and sewing schools in
which Miss Howard was interested. This lady had never considered her very
intelligent, but she had a pretty face, with childish features, and an
appealing glance in her deep, gray eyes which made her many friends. Marion had
lost sight of her for more than a year, and only the day before her visit to
the stable learned her sad story.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Not being very happy
in the family where one of the mission-school teachers had placed her, she was
easily persuaded to leave it for employment in a cigar factory. There she
formed the acquaintance of a young fellow by the name of Cole, and soon after
was married to him. If she had taken to heart the instructions of her faithful teacher,
she would have distrusted the principles of a man whose first act in connection
with her was deceit.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>As they were both
infants in the eye of the law, Esther being but sixteen, and her husband to be
but eighteen, the clergyman refused to perform the ceremony unless one of the
parents, was present and wished it. Leaving her sitting on the steps to the
house, he hurried off, and soon returned with a woman who said she was his
mother, and who declared her willingness for her bye to be married.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>They were married, and
young Cole took his wife home to a house where he had lodgings, where they had
many a laugh about the ease with which he had found a mother in his emergency,
he having given the woman twenty-five cents to personate such an individual.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Esther's character was
so yielding that she got along for a few months without much trouble. She never
knew what her husband's business was, and often wondered why it kept him so
long into the night. At last he began to abuse her, and grew so irritable that
she begged to be taken back to her old place in the cigar factory, where, at least,
she had kept herself from starving. Now young Cole had been arrested for
burglary, tried, and sentenced to prison for three years, and Esther, innocent,
ignorant even of his ever having committed crime, was suspected of being
connected with the plot.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Even Hepsey, who tried
to harden her heart against pity, having been so often deceived, was affected
by the utter abandonment to grief of the young girl. She was sitting on a bed
of straw, with a child of her sister-in-law across her lap, her head fallen forward
on her breast, her tears falling on the sleeping babe's face, seemingly unconscious
of the presence of any one.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;She's just gone
daft with her trouble, poor thing,&quot; explained the woman, as she saw the
eyes of her visitors fastened on the child-wife.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It was difficult to
rouse her from her grief. When addressed, she looked up frightened, supposing
officers had come to take her to jail. Then, recognizing Miss Howard's kind
face, she asked, piteously,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Will they keep
me in prison long?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mrs. Cole took the
babe from her arms, explaining, &quot;I thought maybe 't would divert her
thoughts,&quot; and then went on to say that Jo, her husband's brother, had
always been a bad boy. He had no business to deceive a young girl, and get
married when he had no home. That Esther was steady and honest, and was never
up to knowing his wicked goings-on. Then she touched her head and pointed to
the poor girl in a significant manner. &quot;As to the robbery, she's as innocent
of it as a babe unborn.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>No one could doubt it
who witnessed the appealing glance in those wondering eyes; at least Miss
Howard did not, but she could not at once decide what course to pursue to clear
the child from the suspicion of crime. Having ascertained that Mrs. Cole was
willing to keep her for a few days, Miss Howard put a sum of money into her hands,
and, promising to do what she could, took her leave.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;She's no more
guilty than I am,&quot; exclaimed Hepsey, indignantly. &quot;That woman thinks
she isn't bright, but it's only because she's been cowed down and abused till
she darsn't say her soul is her own. I remember her when she was as tidy and
spry as the best of 'em.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Why, Hepsey,
where did you ever see her?&quot; </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;At the sewing
school, ma'am, where I used to go in yer place while yer was in Grantbury; and
Esther Sims, as they called her then, was the most respectful and the best
behaved of the whole class.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Hepsey, do you
think she could be trained by kindness to be a good servant?&quot; Marion's
voice was abrupt in her earnestness.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Indeed I do,
ma'am. To be sure, it would take time, but it would be a deed o' mercy, and
like as not be the saving of her soul.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Well, my dear,
good Hepsey, you have helped me through a great many difficulties. If we can
get the poor child away from her surroundings, you shall have the chance to try
and save her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Hepsey was startled.
This was rather beyond what she had thought of. Presently she asked, abruptly,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What will she do
with her thief of a husband?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;She must be made
absolutely free from him, of course. I will take advice about it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I suppose you're
thinking of yer own home in the country, ma'am, and that is where I'm to train
her,&quot; added Hepsey, with a sly glance into her young mistress's face.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>A rosy blush was the
only reply.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>While Marion was
hesitating to whom she should apply for advice in regard to poor Esther, Mr.
Mitchell came home. He assured her that by the laws of the State the husband's
incarceration in prison rendered the wife free from the marriage tie. He also
comforted her by saying, that even if Esther were arrested, unless some one appeared
against her, the case could not be carried on. Marion, however, with the
recollection of the child's look of terror at the very thought of being
arrested, was determined to prevent it if possible.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Suddenly recalling to
mind Mr. Lambert's promise to aid her in her works of charity, she sent James
to his house to request him to call at his earliest convenience.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>When he came, which
was almost immediately she was struck with a change in his appearance; and
inquired, anxiously,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Are you ill,
sir?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What makes you
ask that? I'm in rollicking health and spirits.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She doubted it,
however, for even while talking with her he seemed to fall into fits of revery.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What a fool she
was to marry so young!' he said, with a sneer; &quot;but, as you say, that
can't be helped now. My advice is, let him go to—anywhere that will keep him
out of her way. But what is to be done with the child?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I think Hepsey
means to take her,&quot; replied Marion, showing all her dimples. &quot;I hope
she can be got off without going to court.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Hepsey, hem! 
Well, never fear. I'll see the judge and settle that. If he won't believe my
word, I'll make him go to the stable, mount the ladder, and see for
himself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He leaned back in his
chair, laughing heartily but Marion noticed that there was no ring of mirth in
his laugh.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Suddenly she said,
&quot;O Mr. Lambert! Are you acquainted with Mr. Regy? I hear of him everywhere
among the poor, and I long to see him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Better
not,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;Take my word for it, he is a good-for-nothing
fellow. I know him well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You must be
prejudiced, Mr. Lambert. His heart is just as warm as yours; indeed, in many
things he must be like you: he delights to relieve suffering and he delights
to—to—what shall I call it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Call it abuse;
that's the right name. He's a hard-shelled old sinner. He tries to salve his
conscience by giving away what he don't want. Keep clear of him, as you would
of the plague. Now I must be going, or I sha'n't see that judge.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>THE very next day he

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It's all
right,&quot; he said. &quot;The girl is free to go where she chooses. Now I
want to ask you a question. Where do you go to church?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I attend
-Church. Dr. M- is my pastor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;But you're not a
member.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh, yes! I have
been for a great many years.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>His countenance
expressed real disappointment. &quot;I could have sworn you didn't believe in
such humbug.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;O Mr. Lambert,
don't say so!&quot; Marion'! eyes filled with tears. She had always supposed
that he was a Christian and a member of some church.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I've never seen
any cant about you. In fact, I took it for granted that you were a good,
common-sense girl. Why, all that nonsense about joining a church and taking an
oath that you believe such and such doctrines has exploded long ago!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Don't you
believe any doctrines?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I believe this:
that it's the life we must look to. Why, I've seen men,—and women too,—who
swallowed the whole creed, covers and all, stiff and straitlaced, thought it a
sin to smile, but who wouldn't give a penny to a poor man to save his soul. I'm
sick of this talk about doctrine. Give me the life,—that's what I look
at.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;But how shall we
know how to live unless we study God's Word? We have exact directions
there,—and these are what I call doctrines. I am sure you believe that Jesus
Christ came to set us an example of a perfect life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'll allow that
for the sake of argument.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Did He ever
sin?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Not that I ever
heard of, but I don't know much about it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Can you name any
other man who ever lived without sin?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Perhaps not. I
always said the world was up side down. But what does that prove? I don't know
what you are driving at.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Then the claim
of Jesus Christ himself, that He was the Son of God, in a peculiar sense,—that
no man can come to the Father except through Him,—is a claim we must
acknowledge.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I don't know
anything about that. You are taking too much for granted.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Why, if any other
man should claim to be divine, saying, in plain terms, 'I and my Father are
one,' he would be seized and punished for blasphemy. It would be monstrous,
presumptuous in the last degree. The fact that Jesus Christ claimed that he was
one with the Father, the fact that he was a sinless being, and could not
therefore be such a wicked impostor, that he proved his assertion by his life, his
teachings, and his power to work miracles, is the great central truth on which
Christianity is based. If you read your Bible prayerfully, as I earnestly hope
you do, you must concede so much.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Lambert twirled
his glove, looked grave, and then said, &quot;Well, what of that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;How do you
suppose the world came to be upside down, Mr. Lambert?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Can't say. Can
vouch for the fact, though. Everything and everybody is helter-skelter.&quot; </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Including Mr.
Regy, I suppose.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes; he is as
bad as any of them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;And needs a
power out of himself to put him right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;That's
true.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;This power we
have in our blessed Saviour. He came to save us from sin and from all its
dismal consequences.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Well, admit that
too, for the sake of argument.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Now, my dear
friend,&quot; urged Marion, seizing his arm and gazing wistfully in his face,
&quot;believing so much, as I am sure you do, you have the very root and
foundation of the Christian doctrine. A good life must and will grow out of
such a belief. Jesus Christ, who was rich, became poor for our sakes. He
sacrificed ease, comfort, home on earth, and all that makes life dear. I say
nothing of the glories of heaven, the worship of myriads of holy beings, which
He willingly exchanged for disgrace, ignominy, and death. I am only speaking
now of Him in His human nature.  He loved us to that extent He was willing to
do and bear all this for us, to make us happy here and hereafter. We must
acknowledge ourselves degraded indeed, if we are not willing to do something to
show our appreciation of such love. What does He ask of us? Only that we return
His love, and cherish kindly feelings toward each other. Love God, and our
neighbor as ourselves. This is the life you so rightly urge that we must live. It
flows naturally from the doctrine. Any other motives than love to God and to
our fellows fail of power to help us live this life.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You see I have
not said a word about the theories that man, in different stages of the world,
has built on these fundamental truths. There always has been and always will be
different ways of explaining God's truth; but speculation is outside of
fundamental truth. Man a sinner, Christ a Saviour, is enough for me. Any man,
woman, or child, really desirous of showing his love to Christ, can find rules
in God's Word to guide him in every emergency.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;About joining a
certain church, for instance.&quot; There was an ill-concealed sneer in Mr. Lambert's
voice.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, we have the
example of companies of disciples gathering themselves together to recount what
God had done for them. Our Saviour himself honored and showed His approbation
of these gatherings by being present with them. The most affecting of all His dying
messages to His disciples was that they should eat bread as a symbol of his
body broken, and drink wine as a symbol of His blood shed for them. This was to
be a continual reminder of what He had done. I can say from my own experience,
that this communing with Christ in His sacrifice brings Him nearer to me not
only as a Saviour but as a friend, or elder brother, than anything else could
do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I don't see any
Christianity in one soul de-crying another, and calling each other hard
names.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I don't see any
Christianity in one man stealing his neighbor's coat, or his property of any
kind. One act is as much Christian as the other. If the disciples of Christ
would only live up to the example He set for us, one man would never decry or
call his neighbor hard names merely because they differ on non-essentials.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;People's likes and
dislikes are as wide apart as their countenances. Because one man has blue
eyes, he needn't decry a man who has black. All that is required of him is that
he shall use aright the eyes God has given him. One man is so constituted that
in his worship of God he prefers liturgy and certain prescribed forms. This
mode, which we call Episcopalian, helps his fervor, and the very forms assist
him to keep his mind from wandering.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Others find
these written prayers, etc., irksome and monotonous: they like more stir and
bustle; such become Methodists. God never expected or intended that we should
all be patterned in the same mould. Social intercourse would be very tame if we
were. Mr. Regy, for instance, has his own method of relieving the poor, and I
have mine,&quot; she added, smiling.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Mr. Regy is an
old humbug,&quot; growled Mr. Lambert. &quot;I'm always ashamed when I've been
in his society. He's the most provoking man I'm acquainted with.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;And yet he is in
a fair way to attain a high position: 'He that humbleth himself shall be
exalted.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Lambert's face
crimsoned, and he muttered some unintelligible words. He caught up his hat and
cane in a hurry, when she said, tenderly,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;May I say
something to you, my dear friend?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Humph! That's
cool! Here you've been driving into me with hammer and tongs, and now you ask
very meekly, may I say something to you?' Well, say on; a few hits more or less
won't kill me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It is only this,
dear sir. When we accept Jesus Christ as our own personal Saviour, He will
flood our souls with such peace and joy as we never before conceived. His love
helps us to bear trials, to meet disappointment with true fortitude, to look
forward without fear to the time when we shall walk through the dark valley. I
shall pray daily that such love as this may fill your soul.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>His face became so
convulsed while she made this personal appeal that she was really alarmed.
Putting a violent restraint on himself, he rallied and exclaimed in a light
tone,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You were cut out
for a theological professor I was not aware of this accomplishment.&quot; He
would not notice the hand she held out to him, but with a gruff &quot;Good
day,&quot; left the room.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>After his departure,
Marion found herself so shaken that she could scarcely collect her thoughts.
She went to her chamber, and with tears plead for her friend. &quot;O God, show
Thy self to him in the face of thy Son, Jesus Christ.&quot; This was the burden
of her petitions.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Fortunately for her,
this was the day of the week when the foreign mail came in. A letter from her
dearest friend would restore her spirits.  While she was waiting for it,
thoughts of Mr. Lambert would intrude, and she was surprised that, knowing him
so intimately as she had for some years, she was so little acquainted with his early
life. &quot;I wish I could comfort him as daughter would. Did he really
disbelieve every thing, as he pretended?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She at last put on her
hat and, summoning Hepsey, went to call on Esther. She was recovering from her
fright, and seemed relieved that she was freed from a bond which had proved
such a burden to her.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I advise her to
go back to her old name again,&quot; explained Mrs. Cole. &quot;Esther Sims she
is to be from this time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Miss Howard promised
that Hepsey should accompany Esther to a clothing store, where suitable outfit
would be provided for her, which she could pay for with her after-earnings.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Am I to go into
the cigar factory?&quot; inquired Esther, with a shudder.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh, no! You are
to live with me. Hepsey has adopted you,&quot; laughing. &quot;I can speak for
her that she will be strict, but kind.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Esther looked up
suddenly, as though she scarcely understood, but, seeing the bright smile on
Miss Howard's face, her own grew radiant then, with a quick movement, she threw
herself on her knees before the lady, while tears of joy ran down her cheeks.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Poor
child!&quot; murmured Marion. &quot;She has known so little the comfort of a
home.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Or having real
friends to care for her,&quot; interrupted Hepsey, wiping her own eyes.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It was indeed a change
in Esther's life, difficult for her, at least, to comprehend. For days after
she went to live with her kind friends, she seemed to herself to be in a dream.
Nothing made it seem so real as the prayers Mr. Mitchell offered when they all
gathered around the family altar. As she told Hepsey afterward, she would go
without food rather than to lose the opportunity of being present.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Do you recollect
a little prayer you taught us at the mission school, Miss Howard?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>This lady and Esther
were sitting at their sewing when the child timidly asked the question. She was
gradually becoming accustomed to kind words, losing the habit of starting, when
suddenly addressed, as though she feared a blow.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Esther's hands trembled
with eagerness as she asked the question.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Do you mean the
prayer which begins, 'Help me, dear Lord'?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes,
ma'am.&quot; The child closed her eyes, bent her head forward just in the old
way she had been taught, and repeated the whole prayer with a solemnity and
fervor which deeply affected the hearer.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Help me, dear
Lord, this day, to be honest, faithful, and true toward my fellows, and above
all to love Thee, blessed Saviour, with all my heart. Help me to remember that
God sees all that I do, and hears all that I say, and that He is able to
protect and guide all those who put their trust in Him. For Jesus Christ's
sake, we ask this. Amen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>With a half-checked
sob the child went on, gradually forgetting her timidity, and giving to her
faithful teacher an insight into her poor, lonely, repressed life which was
never forgotten.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;O Miss Howard!
it frightens me to think how bad I was at the mission school. I used to whisper
and set the girls to laughing, and waste my thread, and do so many naughty things.
Miss Farnum ought to have put me out. But if she had,&quot; sighing, &quot;I never
should have learned that good prayer&quot; (speaking with great awe) &quot;and
then what should I have done when I was in such trouble?</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I used to kneel
in the corner and repeat it over and over till it seemed like I heard Jesus'
voice say, 'I will, child.' Once when he&quot;—she always alluded to her
husband as he—&quot;came home drunk, and beat me, I worried 'cause I couldn't
get to my corner and kneel down. I did manage to sit up in bed and put my hands
together as you told us, and I said it over and over in my heart. I thought,
maybe as He knows all about us, He'd know how it hurt me to move, and wouldn't mind
if I did cry and moan, 'cause I couldn't help it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;My poor child. I
am very glad you knew where to go for comfort. Did you ever try to form a
prayer for yourself?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;No, ma'am, not a
prayer. I wasn't fit for it, you know; but when he was swearing and threatening
to kill me,—not him, but rum,—I used to whisper, O God, pity me. Dear Jesus,
take away the bad heart that makes him treat me so. Once after I had asked God
to make him good and help me to be patient, he came and looked at me as I lay
on the straw. He wasn't drunk then, and he said, 'I'm sorry for your sake you
ever saw me, Esther.' His voice was real kind, like as though he pitied me.
When he'd gone, I told Jesus about it. Was it naughty?&quot; as she saw Miss
Howard suddenly put her handkerchief to her eyes, &quot;and I loved Jesus
Christ so much that I forgot all the pain in my head and my side, so I fell
asleep.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Esther, for years a
member of the mission Sunday school,—light and frivolous, seemingly almost
incapable of retaining any of the teachings repeated Sunday after Sunday in her
hearing,—had been impressed by something in this simple prayer which the
gracious spirit of God had fixed in her memory. It seemed to have been the &quot;word
in season,&quot; which had come back to her in her hours of deepest need, and
proved to her in truth that God was really a loving Father watching over and
pitying His sorrowing children.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion related the
incident which had so deeply affected her to her friend in England adding,
&quot;I suppose I may learn from this a lesson of trust. We have the glorious
privilege of sowing the seed in the hearts of these poor waifs. It is God's
part, which He has promised to do, to help it to sink into the light soil and
spring up to everlasting life.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;How many times I
have heard people say, 'Such work does no good. The influences around these
poor creatures are all against them. Once in seven days they repeat the command
not to swear, not to steal, not to lie, and every hour of the other six days
they hear the vilest oaths and are witness to a breach of every other command. If
it were any truths but God's own truths, which He has promised to bless, we
might well be discouraged; but in the case of Esther, when to human appearance
all her surroundings were against her, one little seed of divine truth sank
into her heart and bore such wonderful fruit that I take fresh courage and feel
that I can labor with fresh diligence.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Never in all her
acquaintance with Mrs. Douglass had our young friend enjoyed her visits there
as now. The lady had recovered from her recent illness, and was able to take a
short walk every day, supported by her daughter's arm. In Mrs. Cheriton's
countenance there was an added beauty. Her eyes no longer flashed defiantly, as
of old. Her head seemed to have forgotten its fashion of throwing itself back,
as she haughtily refused any request which crossed her own inclinations. Upon
her brow there was a sweet serenity that spoke to the observer of inward peace.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>I have already spoken
of the change in her treatment of her boy. Her resolutions made during that
dreadful night were never forgotten. Conscience, once aroused, did not slumber
again. She prayed earnestly that she might have help to command her own temper,
and thus be able to teach Geenie to conquer his. The resemblance in many of her
traits to her uncle Henreich, which has caused her mother hours of anxious forebodings,
grew less and less every day. She saw that her daughter was making a great
effort to correct her faults, and that in her government of her son she was
kind but firm.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Formerly, as Marion
went into their room, she was aware that her entrance had interrupted some
unpleasant discussion. Mrs. Douglass would either be trembling with agitation
or in tears while Mrs. Cheriton was flushed and defiant.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Now what a pleasing
change! The two ladies sat at their work, regarding each other with the tender
affection natural to the tie between them, while Eugene, sometimes boisterous
indeed, was growing every day more willing to yield to authority.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>One morning Marion
called on her way to her pupils, who, by the way, were making their best
efforts to show her they appreciated her self-denying efforts, as she had
informed them she intended to resign her place in the school. She met Eugene,
dressed for a walk, with a young companion from the house; and descending the
stairs, found the ladies improving the time in reading an interesting book.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I want you to
tell Miss Howard about Geenie's prayer,&quot; remarked Mrs. Douglass to her
daughter.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I really
hope,&quot; began Mrs. Cheriton, &quot;that he understands what I have told
him, that God sees us, though we can't see Him. Yesterday afternoon we were
sitting here with the door open into the next room. I heard a noise like
driving a nail, but supposed he was busy with his toys, and presently I heard
his voice. We both listened and heard him say,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'God, don't look
this way! Turn your eyes the other side. I'm very naughty, God. Don't see me!
Look over there! I'm SO naughty, God, I don't want you to see.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;By this time I
concluded it was best for me to see what the hammering meant. I went in and
found him driving tacks into the trunk.  He made no resistance when I took away
the hammer, but looked ashamed when I said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'O Geenie! How
could you do so?'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You can imagine
how he would have resisted once,&quot; added the boy's grandmother. &quot;He
would have kicked and screamed and tried to bite.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I am thankful
those days are past,&quot; murmured Marion, noticing the mother's flush of
painful recollection caused by this allusion. &quot;He will reward you for all
the pains you take to control him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;He has
already,&quot; exclaimed the young mother, clasping her hands in her impulsive
manner. &quot;Geenie was never so affectionate as now. I do believe that he
never loved me so well as when I had to punish him the other day. He hung
around me, kissing me again and again. When he saw tears in my eyes, he took
his own little handkerchief to wipe them away, saying repeatedly,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Geenie will be
good all the time, mamma. Geenie won't make mamma cry any more.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion was sometimes
very curious to know whether, with the many obvious changes in Mrs. Cheriton's
character, her feelings of aversion to her husband remained. She was well aware
that many of the former disagreements with the mother arose from the fact that
Mrs. Douglass urged Juliette to write kindly to her husband, from whom they had
heard within a few months. To be sure, he had not sent them any intelligence,
but in a newspaper accidentally falling under their notice, they had seen his
name and knew he was then in New Orleans. If there was any return of affection
on the wife's part, no one knew it, for on this subject she maintained the most
rigid reserve.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Indeed, Mrs. Cheriton
could never be called a frank person. It was only under the influence of very
strong emotion that she gave utterance to her deepest feelings. From the first,
Marion had noticed this trait, and wondered at it in one so young.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>With another
child-wife it was exactly the reverse. To her earliest friends—Miss Howard and
Hepsey—Esther laid bare all that was in her childish and grateful heart.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion often came upon
her, singing in a low musical voice, a refrain from the hymn sung at family
prayers, and when spoken to she had a way of looking up with her large,
deep-set eyes, and smiling, as she said softly,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'm so happy,
ma'am. Everybody is so kind to me.&quot; And this was while the great ridges on
her slender body, caused by her husband's brutal beatings, were still unhealed.
In regard to this husband she did not hesitate to speak, though at first with
tears.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Would it be
wicked, ma'am, to let him think I belong to him now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She asked this one
morning when she was braiding her young mistress's abundant tresses and could
keep her own face concealed.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What do you
mean?&quot; Marion was startled and spoke in a sharp voice.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I mean, ma'am,
he's shut up now and can't get rum; and he was kind, once; and wouldn't he feel
better if he knew that I cared for him a little?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You said you did
not care for him; that you never wanted to see him again. Would you go back to
him? Would you submit to his ill treatment, his profanity and abuse?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Esther was silent, and
glancing in the mirror, her mistress saw that her eyes were full of tears. At
last she said, in a tone of deep sorrow,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'm sorry God
heard me say that. I was angry at the bad rum, and I was afraid of being shut
up in a cell with him. I—I asked Jesus to put my naughty feelings away. I—I
found the place in your prayer-book, ma'am,—I mean the marrying place. It's
solemn words, ma'am; I didn't know that marrying was such a solemn thing. I was
too young, and I had no mother, and my mates thought it would be fun to be
married, and I didn't remember that I should have to stay married whether I
liked it or not and so when he praised me and said he loved me best of all the
girls in our court, though they all wanted him, I said I'd go to the parson. I
had no call, ma'am, to let him say that bad woman was my mother. She was old
Nan, the worst woman among them all, but that is over now. I'd die before I'd
do so naughty again, but, ma'am, the minister asked me those solemn words, and
I said yes, so I've been thinking that,&quot; sighing heavily, &quot;'for
better for worse, till death us do part,' means that I do belong to him, ma'am
and so I—&quot; Her voice was stopped suddenly for she fell on her knees, and
with her head hidden in her arms, sobbed without restraint.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion's own tears
flowed. As she told the story afterward to Mrs. Mitchell and Hepsey, &quot;When
I saw her in a perfect abandonment of grief, sobbing her heart out at the
recollection of the man who had so abused his trust, I resolved that, if the
law could prevent it, she never should live with him again. But at the same moment
I felt for her such an increase of respect that folded her in my arms and
kissed her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>A few days after this
Miss Howard was dressing to go out when Esther came forward, blushing
painfully, and holding out an awkwardly folded paper, asked,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;May I go out,
ma'am, to put this into the box at the corner?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The lady took the
letter and glanced her eye over the address, &quot;Joseph Cole, Sing-Sing Prison,
Auburn, New York State.&quot; The writing was scarcely intelligible, but Marion
was not thinking of that. She could not endure the thought that Esther in her
childish trust might bind herself irrevocably to his future.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;His sister told
me how to write that,&quot; murmured Esther, in a hesitating tone. &quot;'T
isn't my place, ma'am, to ask you to give your time to it; but if you'll please
to read it, and say I may send it to him, I shall be very happy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>This was what Marion
wished to do. She seated herself instantly and unfolded the paper, not yet
sealed, Esther meanwhile ruffling the edge of her apron as though her life
depended on her doing it quickly.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion had never
perused a letter in which all the rules of grammar and spelling were so wholly
set at defiance; but seldom had she read one which touched her heart more. It
was very brief, but to the point, and correcting the spelling, read as
follows:—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Dear Jo,—</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>It's a good while
now since you and me see each other.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>I thought, maybe,
you'd like to know that a dear, kind lady, as used</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>to teach me in the
Mission, is giving me a home. I'm happy, or I</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>would be if I could
forget where you are. I'm learning to pray, Jo;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>and when I say my
prayers I never forget that God can look right into</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>your cell and see
you, though I can't; so I tell him all about you,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>and ask him to make
this the best time in your life, as it may be if</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>you will learn to
love Him. You are not yet twenty years old, and</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>when you come out
of prison you will be young enough to begin life</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>again. This is what
I am praying for you all the time.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Your little wife, ESTHER.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;If she had left
out the words 'your little wife,'&quot; said Marion to herself, &quot;I would
not have objected to her writing him for once.&quot; Then glancing up, she saw
Esther's eyes fixed upon her with a mournfully earnest expression, and without
another word went to her desk, took out an envelope, enclosed the letter in it,
copied the address, and let it go. Afterward she confessed, &quot;I believe at
that moment I felt far more unforgiving toward the prisoner than the innocent
victim of his brutality did.&quot;</span></p>

<h1><a id="Part_2_Chapter_8"><span class='c8'>CHAPTER VIII.</span></a></h1>

<h1><span class='c6'>GAMES AND ENTERTAINMENTS.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>ALL this time the
building committee in Grantbury were pressing on the work most vigorously. The
edifice was unlike any other in the town. It was of Gothic architecture. The
walls were, as I have mentioned of native stone, the windows high, narrow, with
stained glass.  &quot;They will have a cross on the spire,&quot; said one,
&quot;I'm sure of it, and I'll tell you what it will end in, they'll all go to
Rome together.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The work proceeded so
well, notwithstanding these prophecies, that it was hoped it would be ready for
occupation by Christmas. Mr. Angus's taste was consulted during the entire
progress.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The plan had been
copied and sent to him for approval.  All the committee agreed that some
suggestions made by him were a great improvement on the original plan. In his
last letter he had told them he expected to sail for home the 17th of
September, and this the committee said would be in time to decide about frescoing
and other interior decorations. No member of the parish, outside of Mr.
Asbury's family, was aware that a new tie had been formed which would
strengthen his affection to the country and home of his adoption. A few persons
knew that a cellar was being dug on a house-lot not two hundred feet from the
new church, but these few supposed Mr. Asbury was going to erect a house to
rent, as he was often seen directing the workmen. The fact was that &quot;our
church,&quot; with its rafters exposed to view, its spire towering every day
nearer to heaven, its ample porch of solid stone, absorbed all the interest of
the congregation.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Every week a letter
came to the church or the Sunday school in which the pastor spoke most
hopefully of what they might together accomplish for the cause of Christ. He
told them what he had seen in England and Scotland, among congregations he had
visited, of united effort. He reminded them, that if they so labored and prayed,
God would surely add His blessing, until there was not one in the limits of the
town who did not love Christ and try to serve Him.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>To the Sunday-school
children he wrote of schools in London and Edinburgh, where all were wide awake
with interest to gather in the poor waifs who knew nothing of Jesus except His
name, which they heard mingled with the most dreadful oaths. He spoke of the
reward these workers received in their own hearts, and urged them to follow so
worthy an example. He mentioned at the close of this letter that he had
subscribed for one of the best English Sunday-school papers, and offered it for
a reward to the child who would bring into their own Sunday school the greatest
number of scholars. These must be from families not connected with any other
church.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>For the first time in
her life dear little Ethel had a secret, and it was her own Marion who told her
of it.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>By and by, when the
new house was done, she knew that her dear Mr. Angus would bring Marion from
the city and go there to live. She knew that a beautiful conservatory was to be
built on the south side of the new house, and that Marion's flowers and birds
would be brought there. She knew that Hepsey and Esther and James would all be in
the pretty home at the new Ingleside, and that she could go to see them as
often as she pleased. She knew why it was that Marion came from New York so
often, and why papa spent so much time talking with her about some large charts
spread out on the dining-room table, about an oriel window here, and a balcony
there, and why they always waited till she was in bed before they walked over
to the spot where the new house was being built.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>One thing more
connected with this wonderful secret she had been told later, and this came
near letting the whole thing out, which would indeed have set the congregation
connected with the First Church into a blaze of excitement. Marion had promised
that on a certain occasion, not very far distant, she should go to New York
with her papa and mamma and Annie and Gardner, and stand up with Marion as
bridesmaid, while she promised to love Mr. Angus and take good can of him as
long as she lived.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It was something to be
remembered, the wonder and delight of the child as she came to understand all
this. Her eyes grew darker, and her whole face radiant, as she glanced slowly
from one to another, and her mamma added,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, darling,
cousin Marion is going to live in Grantbury and be Mr. Angus's wife.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;And I'll be his
wife, too,&quot; she exclaimed, with a little hop of delight. &quot;I'll
promise to love him and take care of him. He can be the broom to both of
us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;The broom!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, mamma, you
said that she would be the bride and he the broom.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Groom, you mean,
you precious pet,&quot; said Marion, catching the child in her arms and hiding
her burning cheeks in Ethel's neck.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mamma thought this too
good to keep from papa, and even threatened Marion that she would acquaint Mr.
Angus with the double honor that awaited him; but the young lady's entreaties
prevailed, and the letter went off without the joke.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The rise of ground on
which the new church was being built was in a part of the town not yet much
occupied by families. The road from the old church, school-house, etc., to the
depot wound gracefully around the foot of the hill, and had been widened and
improved within a short time. It was about one quarter of a mile to the
railroad station, and an equal distance from the village, which had grown up in
what was once the centre. Prior to the existence of the railroad, it was Mr.
Asbury's most profitable grass land, and he now owned as far as the depot on
one side, and quite down to Shawsheen Lake on the other. The elevated situation
of the land, together with the picturesque views it commanded, rendered it
peculiarly eligible for building lots. Speculators from the city had already
made favorable offers to the owner for the whole field, but, with the exception
of one hundred feet front by one hundred and fifty deep, donated to the church,
and a house-lot nearly four times the size, next adjoining, Mr. Asbury refused
to sell.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Angus's letters to
Marion kept her informed of his visits to London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow, where
he was studying into the best-approved methods of church work in reference to
his own labors among his chosen people. He told her of sewing schools, not only
for children, but for mothers, where they were taught to cut and make garments
for boys and girls, given simple recipes for cooking, and taught in general how
to make home happy. He narrated cases where, in consequence of these teachings,
the husband had been won from the alehouse to the pleasures of his own
fireside, where the savory soups the wives had learned to make had weaned them
from liquor: and made them into peace-abiding citizens.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He wrote of libraries
and reading-rooms established for the poor, and also of societies for social
pleasures, amusement, etc., to which all were invited to contribute their
share.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;I accompanied
a friend,&quot; he wrote, &quot;to one of these gatherings,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>which reminded me
of a description Annie Asbury gave me of one of</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>yours. The ball

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>as was comfortable.

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>to you vividly
enough the inspiration I derived from the scene,—</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>the smiling faces,
the merry voices, the ring of real, healthy</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>enjoyment of the
whole company. Surely I thought, to provide</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>healthful and
innocent amusement for young and old is an important</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>part of church
work. To stand still a moment and listen to the hum</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>and buzz of
cheerful voices, with now and then a burst of laughter,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>sent a glow of
kindly interest for every one present through my whole</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>being.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;There were
games and puzzles and comic readings with an occasional</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>tragedy, and
singing from boys in chorus, and boys or girls in solos,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>and a couple of
street boys with bagpipes, until the allotted hour</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>to close arrived.
Then I as a stranger from the far-off America,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>was requested to
make a brief address and close with prayer. When the</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>bell calling to
order was rung, I was surprised to see how quickly</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>every one found a
seat, waiting to hear what was said.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;I had just
commenced to tell them about my home across the water,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>when a small hand
near me was raised, and a boy asked timidly,—</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;'Tell us
about the bears and Indians, mister.'&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;I had some
difficulty in convincing them that in the United States</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>we had cities and
towns, as they had, and that our bears were kept</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>in cages or pits,
as theirs were. I told them I was very glad to be</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>with them when they
were having such a merry time; and that I wanted</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>to join my thanks
with theirs to the kind Christian ladies and</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>gentlemen who had
provided such an entertainment for us.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;To the loving
Father who watches over us all, to the sympathizing</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Saviour who endured
temptation and want that He might know how to</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>help us, to the
gracious Spirit, who is ready to lead us into every</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>good way, I then
committed them, and we separated.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;I forgot to
tell you that I was persuaded in the course of the</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>evening to sing a
comic song, which I learned while in New York.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Of course this
'brought down the house.' How would my dear little</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Ethel have looked

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In another letter he
said:—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;I have conversed
with many clergymen and other Christians of ripe</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>with rare exception
of peculiar individuals, agree that some</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>relaxation is
necessary to a healthful state of body and mind. If no</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>innocent and proper
amusements are provided, young and old, rich and</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>poor, will seek
entertainments for themselves, and too often these</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>will be the lowest

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>IT was a sultry August
day. Most of Miss Howard's acquaintances were out of the city. She had just
returned from Grantbury, and was finishing a letter to send by the steamer,
when Dr. Ross was announced.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;One minute,
Doctor,&quot; pleaded Marion, sealing her letter and ringing for James to take
it to the post; &quot;now I will have a glass of lemonade for you in a
trice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I met
Hepsey,&quot; he said, &quot;or I should not have known you were at home.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Your call is
very opportune, sir,&quot; said Marion smiling, as she added, &quot;I want to
ask about Annie Leman. Is she as good a teacher as you expected?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Next to
yourself, Miss Howard,&quot; bowing formally, &quot;I do not know her
equal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Then you will
add your influence to mine to secure for her the position I am about to resign
in Mrs. La Vergne's school?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;With great
pleasure, if you will promise for Miss Leman that she will still teach my
daughters. But why do you resign?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion had more than
once asked herself whether she were treating her father's old friend with
sufficient frankness in not telling him of her engagement to Mr. Angus; and now
his question gave her the opportunity to do so; so with rosy cheeks she said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'm going to
leave the city before long.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Not permanently,
I hope?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I am going to be
married, Doctor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Wh-e-e-w-w!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion laughed till
all her dimples came into view.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;To whom, in the
name of wonder?&quot; </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;To a clergyman,
a country parson.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Just like you. I
might have known no other man would have dared aspire. Well, tell me all about
it. You'll ask me to the wedding, of course. Is he presentable, in person, I
mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You shall have a
chance to judge for yourself, Doctor. I will tell you one thing about him. He
has recently declined a call to a large church in London, with a generous
salary, preferring to remain with his country flock; and when they offered to
make the support received from them equal to the other rather than to lose him,
he declined that, too, insisting that there would be so many calls for money in
connection with church work that he preferred they would give that way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The Doctor laughed.
&quot;I see he has found out the method to gain your confidence. Where is the
parish? I shall expect an invitation to visit you and hear your parson
preach.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;When I have a
home of my own, Doctor, you will always be welcome.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Thank you. You
are a good girl; and if you can say my old friend, Dexter Howard, would approve
this new arrangement, I must give my consent. I wish you weren't going out of
the city, though. What will all your poor people do?  By the way, I'm
forgetting in my astonishment at the news what I came for. Did you know Mr.
Lambert was sick, confined to his room?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'm very sorry
to hear it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;That isn't the
worst of it. He charges you with being the cause.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Charges me? What
have I done? I have not even seen him for weeks, and supposed him out of the
city.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;He has been in
bed. He is hollow-eyed and nervous to a degree—that is not particularly
agreeable to his household, I imagine. I can't make out whether the man is out
of his mind, or what is the matter with him. When he had berated you as much as
I thought prudent, I apologized in your name; was sure you had no intention, and
so forth; but he only grumbled the worse. He was sure you did mean it; and if
you saw him you would do it again. I couldn't make out what you had done,
except that he said you had hurt his feelings.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh, I know
now!&quot; exclaimed Marion, with a breath of relief. &quot;I'm so glad, so
very glad!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Glad? He said
you would be, but I indignantly denied it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;May I go and see
him, Doctor? Please let me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I don't believe
he would admit you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, he would. I
must go, dear Doctor. So you may as well say yes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The physician looked
her keenly in the face, as though considering, when she interrupted him by a
burst of feeling, eyes moist, lips tremulous, as she exclaimed,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'm so glad!
It's just what I've been praying for.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Hem! Well, I
hope you'll continue to be glad when you see him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh, Doctor,
you've lived in New York a long time. Do you know anything about his early
history?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>A shake of the head
was the only answer at first, then, after a pause, &quot;He is a native of this
city, I think; and, by the way, one of his most fidgety crotchets now is about
making a will. Shall he make a will? If he does, who shall he leave his money
to? Is there a boy by the name of Carter? Neddy Carter?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, his feet
were crushed and had to be amputated. Mr. Lambert has been a generous friend to
him, but the boy knows him only by the name of Regy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Whew! you don't
say that the eccentric individual known as Regy is Mr. Lambert in disguise.
Why, the manner in which the man abused him this very morning was a
caution.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I feel quite
sure they are the same,&quot; replied Marion, laughing.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The doctor lay back
his head in perfect amazement. At last he said, &quot;Lambert and old Regy the
same. It's the richest joke of the season. What can be his motive? Did you ever
hear of an adventure in Richmond in which he figures prominently?</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;No, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;He was passing a
few days there, when one morning early he signalled to an omnibus to stop. Two
or three vehicles were in the way, so that when the driver was able to draw up
toward the curbstone Regy stood back twenty feet or so. He came on growling and
stood outside, berating the driver for not attending more promptly to his
signal.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'll have you
dismissed, you rascal,' he shouted, his arm upraised, when he happened to
notice the driver's face. It was drawn with pain. Regy jumped up on the box
without another word, learned that the driver's wife lay dying at home,
dismissed him at once, and drove the omnibus himself all day. Then he found the
house where the driver lived. The wife was dead and the children mourning over
her cold body. Regy went to the office, got the driver off for a week, paid the
funeral expenses, and then secured a place for the man on a farm, his oldest
daughter keeping house.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Those were
exactly the facts, as I was told them by a gentleman from Richmond.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It was just like
him,&quot; said Marion, with a merry laugh. &quot;I wonder what his motive is
for disguising his real nature. Now, Doctor, warm as it is, I must go to see
him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It was, however, with
a quickened beat of the pulse that, after her ring at the door-bell, she
awaited admittance to the spacious, old fashioned house.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The servant was a man
who had been in Mr. Lambert's employ for many years. He recognized Miss Howard,
but was doubtful whether his master would see any one.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Tell him I have
just heard of his sickness and am very anxious to see him. Stay, wait a
minute!&quot; she cried, with a sudden resolve, &quot;say that I want to tell
him a piece of news personal to myself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Even when she sat in
the parlor she heard the loud growling of the master as the servant announced a
guest.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It was several minutes
before the man came back, with a troubled countenance, to say that Mr. Lambert
would see her. &quot;I told him he'd better not,&quot; he explained, &quot;and
that set him that he would. He's very, very bad to-day, miss; perhaps you'd
better say nothing to cross him. I'll be close at hand if you want me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>For one instant her
courage failed, then with an earnest lifting up of her heart to God for help
she ascended the stairs and passed into the room.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Lambert had often
surprised her with his eccentricities, but never so much as now. He was lying
dressed in a suit of white duck, on a luxurious lounge, his face almost as
colorless as his dress, and altogether so changed that she felt a disposition to
scream. He held out his hand, saying in a most polished manner, &quot;You must
excuse me, my friend, for not rising. I am quite reduced by illness.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Trying not to show her
surprise, Marion cordially seized his hand and drew a chair close to his side.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'm so sorry I
didn't know it before; I'm a very good nurse, and you must let me try my skill
on you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>His chin began to
twitch with his efforts at self-control, so she added at once, hoping to change
the current of his thoughts, &quot;We've been such good friends that I know you
will be glad to hear some news about me from myself. I'm going to change my
name soon.&quot; Her cheeks, dyed with blushes, explained her meaning.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Is it to that
bow-legged donkey you've pledged yourself,&quot; he shouted, starting from his
pillow. &quot;If it is, I protest!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;No, indeed, it
is not he,&quot; she laughed, understanding to whom he referred, as he had
warned her against him. &quot;My friend is a clergyman, a real, working
Christian. I must tell you how I first met him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She related the
incident of selling him the gloves, at which he laughed heartily, and when she
went on to tell what Mr. Angus wished to do for his people, he caught her hand
and gave it a hearty shake, saying, &quot;He's the kind. I'll consent to
that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You must treat
me as you would a daughter,&quot; she said, putting her hand on his forehead,
&quot;and tell me when you're tired of hearing me talk. Don't you like to hear
reading?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Sing,&quot; he
said, &quot;sing something lively.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She sang several
secular songs, and then one beginning,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Jesus, Thou art
all compassion,&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>which brought the

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Another,&quot;
he said, briefly, when her voice ceased.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, Mr.
Lambert, I'll sing a favorite hymn, which I am sure you will like.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Lord, lead the
way the Saviour went</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>By lane and cell
obscure,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And let love's
treasures still be spent,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Like His, upon the
poor.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Like Him through
scenes of deep distress,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Who bore the world's
sad weight,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>We, in their crowded
loneliness,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Would seek the
desolate.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'For Thou hast
placed us side by side</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In this wide world of
ill,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And that Thy followers

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The poor are with us
still.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mean are all offerings

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>If given for the
Saviour's sake,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>They lose not their
reward.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>When she sang the last
lines he suddenly covered his face, but while she was hesitating how to begin a
conversation on another subject, he exclaimed, irritably,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It's no use
trying to make one's self believe what he knows can't be true.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I am sure of
that, dear friend.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You, sure? Then
how am I to blame for not believing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'> </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Suppose I was
stricken down with want. I was dying of hunger. Just before me there is
abundant supply of food, but I can't raise myself to get it; my weakness has
rendered me powerless. You come in, and seeing my condition, point to the
food.  I can't see it, or I can't reach it.  'Try,' you say. I try, but fall
back.  'Ask me, and I'll give it to you.' You kindly urge this upon me, but I
refuse. 'No, I don't believe it's for me. That food is for somebody else'; and
so I lie there and die for want of the food, stubbornly resisting every motive
you urge—that it is free to all, the only condition being that I ask for it.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;That is a very
weak illustration of what we, as sinners before God, do continually. Christ has
provided an abundant feast; we are starving for want of that very food. He
graciously invites us, 'Come without money and without price,' but we persist
in saying, 'I know it can't be true. That food looks inviting, but it is not for
me.' Now comes in the gracious Spirit, with His soft, pleading voice. He repeats
Christ's words, 'I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.'  'To Him give
all the prophets witness, that through His name whosoever believeth on Him
shall receive remission of sins,'—shall be welcomed to the feast; and by it be
restored to life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>One hand covered Mr.
Lambert's face, and through the fingers Marion saw the tears trickling down.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'm tired,
perhaps you've stayed long enough,&quot; he said softly.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She rose at once,
gazed in his face, longing to comfort him.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Stop a minute.
Pray for a poor old sinner, who has never before had a daughter to comfort
him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Her breath almost
stopped. &quot;Can I pray before him?&quot; But before he noticed her
hesitation she was on her knees at his side. Like a little child, running to
his father whose arms were outstretched to fold her in his embrace, so she ran
to her Heavenly Father, and told Him all her desires for this dear friend. She
asked the Saviour to reveal Himself to the poor, desolate heart, wearied with
carrying its burden alone. She pleaded with the gracious, waiting Spirit to
help him open his heart to this dearest and truest of friends; that the Holy
Spirit would take of the things of Christ, and show them unto him; that, like
the man dying of hunger, he might ask for the food from the abundant supply
before him, and be filled.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Poor Mr. Lambert! He
wholly lost control, and, before she rose from prayer, sobbed without
restraint. As she took his hand to wish him good by, he looked up into her face
with such a pitiful expression that it almost overcame her.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh,&quot; she
exclaimed, &quot;do trust Him!  He is waiting for you to say, 'Lord, I
believe!'&quot;</span></p>

<h1><a id="Part_2_Chapter_10"><span class='c8'>CHAPTER X.</span></a></h1>

<h1><span class='c6'>NEDDY CARTER'S MISSION.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>WHEN Neddy Carter was
carried from the hospital, he was at once admitted to one of the mission
schools; but he begged so hard that he might still make his home with his
mother that he was permitted to do so. He said nothing of his motives in
preferring a bed on a pile of straw to a comfortable cot in the mission house,
but he had a strong motive, which soon began to appear.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Unassisted and even
unknown to his best friends, he gathered a few little ones in his mother's
garret, and then repeated to them the instructions he had gained. Perhaps his
pleasant blue eyes, gazing so frankly into theirs, had made him a favorite before;
or it might be that the sight of him, wheeling about in his chair, enduring so bravely
the great trial that had come upon him gave him influence over his companions.
At any rate, he had influence and he used it to win them to better paths.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Miss Howard learned
something of this, and was so rejoiced at it that she resolved to visit him in
his home. She had never been there since the day of Neddy's accident, when,
with Hepsey's help, she had had him conveyed in the ambulance to the hospital.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>This visit occurred on
the Sunday afternoon following her call on Mr. Lambert, described in the last
chapter. It so delighted her that she longed for Mr. Lambert to know how the
boy he had befriended was using his influence for Christ.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>On Thursday of the
following week she called upon the sick man, and found he was out for a drive.
Sitting in his room, she wrote him a hurried note, asking him to accompany her
to see a mutual friend on Sunday afternoon, enclosing in the note a piece of
poetry she had selected for him. She left the whole with the servant,
requesting an answer to be sent to her house.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Let us look upon Mr.
Lambert as he enters his chamber, leaning upon the arm of his valet. The note
has been placed in plain view from his lounging chair, and he notices it as
soon as he has taken his seat.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Who sent
that?&quot; he asks.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The tone is much
softer than when Marion called last. Perhaps his sickness has weakened him.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Miss Howard
called, sir, and finding you out, wrote her errand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Glad I was
away.&quot; Even while uttering the words he felt that they were untrue.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He took the note in
his hands,—thin, bony hands, showing his sickness. &quot;Get me some
gruel,&quot; he said, &quot;I'm tired, and shall try to sleep.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Shall I say you
cannot see any one?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;How many times
must I repeat that I see no one but the doctor?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;There is an
answer required to the note.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>As soon as he was
alone he tore open the envelope, took out the half-sheet on which Marion had
copied a beautiful extract from Schiller, laid it without reading on his knee,
and then, slowly adjusting his glasses on his forehead, began to read.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;After all,&quot;
he said to himself, &quot;I needn't have dreaded it so much. I was
unnecessarily alarmed. I thought she meant to bring another sledgehammer to
bear on my conscience. Yes, I'll go and see our mutual friend. I wonder who it
is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He took up the other
paper and read,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>The inhabitants of
earth.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;Have love.

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Thy charities on
all.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;Thus 'grave
these lessons on thy soul,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Hope, Faith, and
Love; and thou shalt find </span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Strength when
life's surges rudest roll, </span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Light when thou
else were blind.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Notwithstanding the
twisted and gnarled branches of this old oak, there was a time, years back,
when it was a straight and vigorous young sapling. It was beautiful to behold,
and gave promise of becoming a lofty, stalwart tree, under which many might
find refreshing shelter. On this thrifty sapling grew an ugly wart, called by
some horticulturists jealousy. At first it might have been removed without
injury to the tree, but it was not. It grew and grew, diffusing it: poison
through all the cellular tissues, until it became deformed, disfigured, and
unsightly.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Strange, but true,
this process of degeneration had been going on in the character of Mr. Lambert,
until, at the time we first knew him, there was only one trait left of his
original nature. This was a peculiar, unquenchable tenderness of feeling toward
the poor and distressed. Suspicious as he had become of all around him, ever
toward the very ones he was trying to save from their own thriftlessness or
crime, this one trail urged him on to give relief; and in this way kept alive
one of the healthiest avenues to real goodness, even though his charities were
often accompanied by a torrent of reproach.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It was this trait, so
congenial to Marion Howard, which drew her to him and led her to suppose he was
actuated by love to his Divine Master. In this she was mistaken. In his inmost
soul Mr. Lambert accused God of having dealt hardly with him, more hardly than
he deserved. He had been wounded in the house of his friends. When his heart
had been most vulnerable, there it had been pierced. He had never forgiven nor
forgotten the blow. Sometimes, when the recollection of all he had been made to
suffer came upon him, he hated himself that he did not revenge himself on all
mankind. &quot;I owe no man anything,&quot; was one of his favorite mottoes;
but after he became acquainted with Marion Howard he did not take much comfort from
it. How closely after their first meeting he had watched her! How he longed to
find her halting! But no, her motions were too transparent. She had genuine
love to God as her Father, to Christ as her Saviour, and it was from this love
her kindness to all around her sprang. This he had been forced to acknowledge
when analyzing her character. It unsettled him and made him more irritable. Sometimes,
when he found himself softened under her influence, he would recall all the
injuries heaped on him,—injuries that had blasted his happiness forever.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In his early days he
had been a ripe scholar, a graduate from one of our best colleges. He had read
on many subjects, and among others on the subject of Christianity. He had read
in the Old and New Testaments, but his heart remained cold in the midst of
sacred fire.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>At times in his life
he had taken pleasure in railing and ranting against everything sacred. In
connection with the holiest Bible teachings he had used the words
&quot;bigotry&quot; and &quot;humbuggery&quot; and &quot;cant,&quot; till he
almost convinced himself that what he said was true. Almost, but not quite.
There was still a spark of truth left in him, if only it could be ignited. He
had been thinking of these questions when he called on Marion and asked whether
she believed in churches, dogmas, etc. Her words, the earnestness, the
assurance she expressed that the Gospel of Christ was indeed good news to men,
that in order to live a good life we must believe on Him and follow His
example, came home to his heart. He could not shake off the fear that he had been
mistaken. He lost his sleep, and at last became so nervous and unsettled, so
irritable and unmanageable, that his valet insisted he should summon a
physician.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>This was his state
when Marion came to his bedside. After she left he called for pen and ink, and
wrote out, as well as he could recall it, every word of her prayer. This he put
in his pocketbook and read over many times in a day, never without tears. The
gracious Spirit of God was near, watching, waiting to be gracious.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>How many times in the
course of the few days following he put Marion's character to the severest
test! He applied the touchstones of love, charity, and good-will, and found she
answered to them all. Yes, her life was a good one, even judged from his
standpoint. She did not act from a desire for the praise of men, but from a
genuine love to Christ, and a desire, in her humble manner, to do good to those
around her. Her note found his heart more tender than it had been for years,
more amenable to good influences. He was not likely to refuse any request she
might make, even to the half of his kingdom. He sent her word that he would be
ready to accompany her at the time appointed.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>On Sunday morning the
weather was so extremely sultry that Marion doubted the expediency of taking an
invalid to a hot, unventilated attic where the air must necessarily be
vitiated. Indeed, she was herself oppressed with such debility and general
lassitude as disinclined her for any exertion. But Sunday was one of her busiest
days. She had a Bible class in the morning with her own servants and those
living with Mrs. Mitchell, church at eleven, and her mission school in the
afternoon, to which she usually devoted two hours. Then church in the evening.
Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell being in the country, she felt that the Bible class was
more than ever important to their servants.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It had been her
intention to call for Mr. Lambert in her carriage on her way home after the
mission school, but, considering the intense heat had just resolved to postpone
her visit to Neddy Carter till another Sunday, when she heard the welcome sound
of distant thunder.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Before it was time to
start for church, the heavy shower had cleared the air and revived her drooping
energies.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Neddy Carter's home
was only a few blocks from the Five Points mission. Miss Howard's carriage was
no novel sight in that vicinity, but, notwithstanding, a group of boys and
girls gathered around, gazing with open mouths as the old gentleman alighted
—and followed the lady slowly up the steps.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Nothing could have
happened more favorably for her project. The room was full, as not only the
little ones, but their fathers and mothers, drawn to the room by the singing,
had crowded in, filling up even the open door. From an adjoining tenement Miss
Howard procured a chair for Mr. Lambert, which she placed in the passage, and an
unpainted stool for herself. An opening hymn had been sung, and then the
children united in repeating with the young teacher the Lord's Prayer.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Peeping through a
space formed by a man's uplifted arm, Mr. Lambert could see the crippled boy
seated in his wheeled chair, in front of group of wondering children. His back
was toward the door, but the spectator could easily imagine the expression of
fervor there would be in his soft brown eyes, the sweet serenity of the brow as
he talked to them on the subjects he held most dear.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You said I might
tell about Jesus being born in a stable to-day,&quot; began one little boy,
raising his hand.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You may tell it
now,&quot; Neddy said, in a cheerful voice.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Questions and answers
followed, showing that many present had been told of the love of Jesus Christ,
even for the most sinful; and then the little missionary, wholly unconscious
that others beside the inmates of the neighboring tenement houses were present,
with a little wave of the hand to command silence, began,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'm going to
tell you the story our teacher told us at the mission school to-day, and then
we will sing our favorite hymn.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;A great many
years ago there was a rich man. He had two sons. One was good and one was bad.
I guess it was the youngest that was bad. He didn't like to work. The other
helped his father on the big farm. Teacher said he thought the good one went
around and told the servants what to do, and was not afraid to work himself.
They had cows and calves and sheep, and all kinds of animals, I guess.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;By and by the
lazy one said he was tired of staying at home. He wanted to travel, and he
asked his father to give him his part of the money and let him go. His father
said yes. So the father and the good son went on together for a great many
years. They were pretty happy, but not very. Can you guess why?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Maybe the father
was a sorrering for the boy who had quit his home,&quot; murmured a mother in
the farthest corner of the room.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;That's a good
guess.  Yes, that was the reason he wasn't happy. He loved his boy and he
didn't like to have him away.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Why didn't he
get a letter writ?&quot; questioned a man who was holding a child on each knee.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I don't
know,&quot; answered Neddy. &quot;I'm sorry I didn't ask teacher that. P'r'aps
he didn't know where to send the letter. But now I'm going to tell you about
the bad son. He had a whole bagful of money, and he thought it would last him
forever. So he kept buying things and spending his money till one day he put
his hand in his bag and it was all gone, every bit. He was hungry, but he had
not a penny to buy food. He didn't dare to kneel down, as we do, and say, 'Our
Father, give us this day our daily bread,' because he had been awfully wicked,
getting drunk and lying and swearing, and doing everything bad. You can't
guess, any of you, what he did at last. Why, he was that hungry he had to hire
out to a farmer who kept pigs, and he watched his chance when nobody was
looking, to steal some of the pigs' food. Before this he used to wear gay
clothes, now he was all in rags. One day he sat down on a stump of a tree. He
was awful homesick. He was tired of being so bad. He thought about his old home,
and how kind his father used to be, and what good things he had to eat, He
remembered how the men working on the farm had enough to eat. All at once he
began to cry, 'I wish I was home. I'm awfully lonely way off here, and nobody
speaks a kind word to me. Nobody gives me even the pigs' food. I'm ragged, too,
and filthy. Oh, what a fool I was to leave my dear old home!'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;He cried and
sobbed, but nobody pitied him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Say, Neddy, did
he die among the pigs?&quot; asked a big girl, putting a finger in her eye to
keep the tears back.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'm coming to
the good part now. After he'd been crying a good while, and feeling real sorry
he had been so wicked, he thought he heard a voice asking,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Why don't you
go home?'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Oh, father
wouldn't have me back!'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Yes, he would.
He loves you still.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Loves me! Can
it be true? Then I'll go right off.' So he got up off the stump and started.
Teacher didn't say how far it was, but at last he came to a place where he
could see his home.  His heart beat dreadfully. 'Will he take me in? Will he?'
Now I'm going to tell you the very words he told himself he would say to his
father. Teacher made us all learn them, 'cause she said every one of us could say
them to God, our Heavenly Father.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'And he arose,
and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, the father saw
him, and had compassion unto him, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed
him. And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in
thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'But the father
said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him, and put
ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet. And bring hither the fatted calf, and
kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: for this my son was dead, and is alive
again; he was lost, and is found.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Is that 'ere a
true story? You don't say he took him right back again?  Whew! I guess he was
glad he went home.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;There's only one
thing more,&quot; added Neddy, when the astonishment had somewhat subsided.
&quot;Teacher said that the good father in the story means God. Everybody who
wanders away from being good, is like the bad son. Just as quick as we are
sorry and ask Him to forgive us, He will. She said that we must remember that
He is ready just as quick as we say we're sorry.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Now we'll sing,
and then the school is done. You must all begin with me,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I am so glad
that our Father in heaven </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Tells of His love in
the book He has given, </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Wonderful things in
the Bible I see, </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>This is the dearest,
that Jesus loves me.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Though I forget
Him and wander away, </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Still He doth love me
wherever I stray </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Back to His dear
loving arms would I flee, </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>When I remember that
Jesus loves me.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh, if there's
only one song I can sing, </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>When in His beauty I
see the great King, </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>This shall my song in
eternity be, </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Oh, what a wonder that
Jesus loves me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>During the whole
exercises, Marion had been aware that her companion was deeply affected. She
had refrained from looking at him, but now, as the school was breaking up, she
asked,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Shall we stop
and speak to him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;No, no! I must
get home. I'm too ill to be here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She had ordered the
carriage to be back in an hour, and was glad to see that it was at the door.
They were seated in it and driving off before the crowd came tumbling down the
stairs.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Lambert sank back
in his seat, looking so pale that his companion was really alarmed. She said
nothing, however, but fanned him continually till they reached his own door.
She herself alighted and rang the bell for the valet to assist his master, who
muttered to himself,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Whatever he's
been up to, he looks like death.&quot;</span></p>

<h1><a id="Part_2_Chapter_11"><span class='c8'>CHAPTER XI.</span></a></h1>

<h1><span class='c6'>MANY BLESSINGS.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>THERE could scarcely
be a greater contrast in two characters among Miss Howard's associates than Mr.
Lambert and Esther Sims, or Esther Cole, as she asked Hepsey to call her for
the present. Poor to the extent that, when she left the home in the stable
loft, she had not a penny in the world and not a garment fit to wear to her new
service, unlearned and ignorant in worldly wisdom, she yet seemed to absorb
into her heart as governing motives to her life such sweet and restful views of
God as her Father and Jesus as her Saviour as caused her young mistress to
exclaim, &quot;Thou and hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and
hast revealed them unto babes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>With a childlike
frankness so peculiar to her, she confided to Miss Howard her increasing trust
that God would answer her prayers for her husband's conversion.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;In that case you
would return to him, I suppose.&quot; Marion wished to test her feelings as a
wife.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>A pretty pink flush
flew all over Esther's face as she lifted her eyes wistfully to the lady's.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;God will take
care of me,&quot; she said. &quot;I am sure He will. It is of him I'm thinking.
Now that he is away from bad people and can't get rum, it is such a nice time
for him to become good. When he comes out of prison, if God wants me to go back
to him, He will let me know it. Sometimes,&quot; she added, in a timid voice,
&quot;I think He will, because I promised for better, for worse, you
know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Would you live
with him if he were to beat you and abuse you as he did before?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, ma'am, if I
were sure God meant it so. I can never be as miserable again as I was
before.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Why can't
you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Because I have a
friend now who would be close by me always.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You mean Jesus
Christ.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, ma'am. Even
if he did get—get out of his mind with drink, and treat me unkindly, I would
tell Jesus, and He would help me to forgive. If I never answered back and
always tried to have a smile and the best home I could make for him, perhaps he
might try to be better. Oh, I should be too happy!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She clasped her hands
to her breast, and looked so like an innocent child in her perfect trust that
Marion shed tears of delight.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>During the first week
in September, Marion went to the Home for the Sick, to see Mary Falkner, who,
with the aid of a cane, was able to walk the length of the ward.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Isn't it
wonderful?&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;The doctors say, with the exception of a
limp in my gait, I shall be as well able to walk as any one. They are all so
kind to me. Who knows but I shall be able to do some church work in your
parish?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;If you are able
we will give you enough to do,&quot; answered Marion, blushing.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>On her way out the
superintendent met her and asked her to step to the parlor for a moment. He
took from his pocket a letter recently received, and handed it to her with an
arch smile. Though he did not know, he suspected the truth of a rumor he had
heard concerning her.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The letter read as
follows:—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Dear Sir,—</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>In memory of God's
goodness to my deceased sister and</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>to myself, while we
were within the walls of the Home for the Sick,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>and in gratitude
for the faithful care to our bodies and our souls,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>by pastor,
chaplain, and nurses, I send you the enclosed check,</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>which I think you

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>a permanent bed in

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>as useful in the

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>prayer of a

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>HAROLD ANGUS.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;The check was
for five thousand dollars,&quot; added the gentleman. &quot;It was an
unexpected thank-offering, and we are very grateful for it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion expressed her
pleasure, adding that Mr. Angus had told her how much he owed to the faithful
teachings he received while in the Home.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>This seemed to our
young friend to be a day to mark with a white stone, it was so full of
blessings. When she reached home she found a letter from Mr. Lambert which
overwhelmed her and sent her to her knees to thank God for answering her humble
prayers.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It was characteristic
of himself in its brevity.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;Kind and

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;The prodigal has

him. He has put off his tattered garments. He has</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>a new robe on him.
His voice rings with a new song. In the better</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>words of another,
this is the language of his heart,—</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&quot;'I cannot love thee

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>So richly Thou hast

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>A few days later
Marion went to Grantbury in answer to a summons from her uncle. The outside
walls of the church were finished, with the exception of the spire. The men
were at work on the dizzy height, and expected to finish it by the middle of
September.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The frame to the new
house was raised and nearly boarded in. Mrs. Asbury said people were beginning
to take quite an interest in it. One lady asked her point-blank if the
clergyman intended to bring home a wife from England, to which she returned a
decided &quot;No.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>During her stay Marion
made a hasty call at the thread and needle store to see the Widow Falkner. Mary
had kept her mother informed of her condition, and also of the great kindness
all the patients received, but she was delighted to see Miss Howard and learn particulars
about her daughter.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Then Marion drove half
a mile in another direction for a call on Farmer Rand's wife, who was still an
invalid.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Seldom had her
appearance created such an excitement. It was evident something pleasant had
happened.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Talk of an
angel, etc.,&quot; said the farmer, with a grand flourish of his hand.
&quot;Sit down, miss. You're as welcome as roses in June. How are ye?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;We've been
thinking a sight about ye,&quot; added the gudewife. &quot;We've had a letter.
Maybe ye know it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;S-sh-sh,
wife,&quot; making a sound like what he would make to quiet his oxen;
&quot;wait a bit, I’ve something to say. Now, miss, did ye ever hear about our
church meetin'?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, indeed, I
heard all the items in detail.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Wall, then, 't
won't be breaking no Scripter rule if I do tell that I was moved to draw a few
hundreds out of the bank and gin 'em to the Lord. 'T isn't that I'm a speakin'
of. That 'ere's only the text to my sarmon, you see. The good book says, The
Lord loveth a cheerful giver,' and I will say for myself and my good woman that
the Lord He helped us to give that 'ere money with as good a will as though we
were spendin' on 't to build a new bedroom out on our south side, as we've been
a plannin' to do for a score o' years. Speak for yourself, Lucy. Am I stating
your opinions correct?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, I was very
glad you did it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Well,
then,&quot; said the farmer, laughing as he flourished his hands again,
&quot;the first part o' my sermon is 'stablished, and I'll go on. Wife, give me
that 'ere Bible, will ye? Now I stan' to it that God holds to His promises even
when men aren't looking for Him to do it. Here it is, He that watereth shall be
watered himself'; and here's another, 'The liberal soul shall be made fat.' Now
look here. Out there on the very edge of my farm there's a piece o' ground o' no
airthly value to me. There's nothin' but sorrel'll grow on 't. I'd ha' given it
to any friend for the askin'.  Wall, one day in come that prince of a man,
'Squire Asbury. I knew by the look o' his eye he meant business.  'Mr. Rand,'
says he, 'I ain't no hand to circumvent' round matters; I go straight to the
p'int.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Go ahead,' says
I. 'I ain't no hand for circumventing, neither.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Mr. Rand,' says
he, 'what will you take for that 'ere corner lot o' yourn that runs out towards
the railroad track?'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;&quot;''Squire

the flowers in May. 'T ain't no vally to me at all.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'No, no,' says
he, laughin'. 'I'm a bargaining for the railroad, and they want to put up a
freight depot there. The lot almost touches the rails. Set your price.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Oho!' says I,
'if that's the talk I calkerlate they're able to pay a little suthing. I'll
agree to any price you'll name. Don't you say so, wife?'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Yes, I will,'
Lucy answered up, loud and prompt.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Squire Asbury
kind o' laughed and repeated it over again. 'You both agree,' says he, 'to
stick to the price I name, be it more or less?'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Yes, we
do.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Well, then, I
want the lot just as it lies, sand and all, coming down to a p'int near the
railroad, and a runnin' back one hundred feet to the rail fence put across
where the land lies even, and I'll give you five hundred dollars for it.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Good land,
'Squire' says I, ''t ain't wuth it.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'It's wuth every
dollar of five hundred to the road,' says he; 'if they have to go a mile
farther either way, they'll have to give six or eight. I'll have the deed drawn
up ready for you and your wife to sign.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Squire Asbury,'
says I as soon as I could catch my breath, 'I believe the Lord sent you here.
When I give that five hundred to the Lord I never thought o' getting it back
again, but you see here 't is, dollar for dollar, and more, too, for the
pleasure o' giving my mite towards the Lord's new meeting-house was wuth the whole
sum. Sure as you live, Lucy and I, we give thanks to God for lettin' of us have
the privilege.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;'Yes, yes, I
know that,' says he, and so he does.  If ever a man was blessed in his basket
and store it's that same 'Squire Asbury. His hand, as the Scripter says, 'is
open to the wants o' the poor.'&quot; He ended with one grand flourish.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion laughed
heartily as she said, &quot;I wish you'd preach that sermon to some of our rich
men on Fifth Avenue who don't know the pleasure of giving. It is as practical a
sermon as I ever heard.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Now, wife, speak
up, if you've anything to say.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Husband and I
have had a letter,&quot; Mrs. Rand said, opening the large family Bible and
taking an envelope from between the leaves. &quot;It has made us real cheery
coming so far, and it has good news in it, too. The pastor is real friendly to
think of us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;The
pastor,&quot; exclaimed Marion, in surprise. &quot;Have you had a letter from
Mr. Angus?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The farmer evidently
understood that he had had his turn, and that his wife now had the floor.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He did not speak, but
he nodded his head and performed other pantomime in such a remarkable manner
that Marion was made aware what news the letter contained before the wife gave
it to her to read.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Yes, there it was in
plain black and white. He told this aged pair that he was going to be married
and settle down among them for life, he hoped. He quoted the words of Solomon,
&quot;A prudent wife is from the Lord,&quot; and he said, &quot;I'm sure mine
is a prudent one, a priceless treasure. That she is from the hands of my Father
in heaven I am equally sure. You will agree with me when I tell you Miss Marion
Howard, your particular friend, has agreed to cast in her lot with me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion kept her eyes
fastened on the letter long after she had finished it. She did not like her
good friends to see how much these manly words had affected her. She folded the
sheet carefully and passed it back, saying, &quot;I am glad he has told
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I guess we shall
be able to hold on to him now,&quot; rejoined Mr. Rand, trying to laugh. But as
Marion rose to go his voice changed to the tenderness of a father. He raised
his hand over her head and pronounced a blessing on her and on her chosen
friend; then sat down suddenly, and blew his nose like a trumpet to conceal how
much he was affected.</span></p>

<h1><a id="Part_2_Chapter_12"><span class='c8'>CHAPTER XII.</span></a></h1>

<h1><span class='c6'>A WONDERFUL DISCOVERY.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>THESE were busy days
with our young friend. In company with Hepsey she went to her old home and
spent a week in looking over bedding and furniture preparatory to having it
removed to Ingleside. Her father's place was let on a long lease, and she was
well satisfied with the care taken of it.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Angus had written
to beg her to consent that the wedding should take place immediately on his
return, but she replied that the house would not be finished till some time
later, and that it was necessary for her to complete her arrangements for her
mission and her protégés among the poor before leaving New York.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Since the change in
Mr. Lambert, the idea of giving the care of certain families to him had floated
through her mind, but she feared he was too impulsive or would be too easily
imposed upon if he undertook mission work. Annie Leman had promised to do all
in her power, and had already proved both willingness and tact in the work.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>On her return from the
country, Marion found a note from Mr. Lambert requesting to see her on
business. She suspected at once it was in relation to his will, about which he
had already spoken to her. She sent James with an answer saying she would call
on him at nine the next morning.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Later in the day she
was pleasantly surprised by a call from Mrs. Cheriton and Eugene. They had
advertised for and obtained a boarding-place in the country a few weeks before,
but not being altogether pleased with the class of boarders they met there, had
suddenly returned to the city the day before.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mrs. Cheriton smilingly
remarked that her mother seemed as pleased as a child to be back in her old
rooms in New York; that she had taken her favorite seat near the window early
in the morning, and had spent an hour or more watching the passers-by; that it
was with difficulty they could persuade her to leave the window even for her
meals.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Geenie gained great
praise for his conduct during the visit. He amused himself with a book of
pictures Hepsey brought him, and did not once touch any article in the room
without liberty from his mother or Marion.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>At a quarter to nine
the next morning Mr. Lambert sent a carriage for Miss Howard, and on her
reaching his house waited upon her to his library, a room adjoining his
chamber. She had never seen this room before, and went around examining the
pictures hanging over the well-filled bookcases.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He had evidently been
writing. Papers covered his table, and his pen was still wet. As he took a seat
near her, the visitor was startled at the marks of the agitation of mind
through which he had recently passed.  His cheeks seemed sunken and a circle
round his eyes betokened want of sleep.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I fear you are
not strong enough for business yet,&quot; she remarked, anxiously.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I'm all
right,&quot; he answered. &quot;I've had letters which have disappointed
me—personal matters. By the way, I may tell you about them some time. To-day I
want to talk about other things.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Miss Howard, I
want to confess Christ. I want to do just the very thing I once thought a
humbug,—to join myself to God's people. I want the help of a faithful pastor to
keep my heart right, and I want the counsel of fellow-Christians as to the best
methods of working for the Master.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion's eyes filled
with happy tears. &quot;I'm so glad, so glad!&quot; she murmured. &quot;Will
you allow me to bring Dr. M—, my pastor, to see you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;No, child, I'm a
poor old prodigal. I want to go among the poor and do what I can there. You
told me once about a mission chapel. That is my place. It may be I can have
courage to do something there, to help men, who, like myself, have lived for
years among the husks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh, how I wish
you would go to our parish in the country! There is a great work to do there,
and you ought to be where your daughter could look after you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;That would be a
great inducement, child. You are nearer to my heart than any other. I have no
ties of kin,—at least I can learn of none. Another time I may tell you the
nature of the disappointment to which I referred. You will pity the poor,
lonely man, I'm sure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>His tone was so sad
that it deeply moved her, and taking his hand she pressed her lips upon it.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Don't do that, I
can't bear it. I shall be unfit for the business if I allow my feelings to have
sway. I have been jotting down a few items in connection with the disposal of
my property. I have more money than I know what to do with. If that interloper
had not stepped in, I would make you my heir, and you could scatter it round as
you please. As it is, I have set aside a few thousands to educate our friend
Neddy, and I want you to look after him if anything happens to me.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What is the name
of that girl-wife you told me about, whose husband is in prison? I want to give
you a thousand for her own use. If she goes back to that scoundrel it must be
so tied up that he can't get at it. Will you have the goodness to pass me that
long paper, ruled with red ink? That's the one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In selecting this
paper from the others, Marion had to move several letters lying on top. As she
did so her eyes fell on an open page, with the name Madrid in full view.
&quot;Madrid! Does he have letters from Madrid? That was Mrs. Douglass's native
place.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Her heart almost
stopped beating, as a sudden possibility flashed like lightning through her
mind. She glanced back at Mr. Lambert. &quot;Could he, oh, could he be the cruel,
exacting man whose jealousy and distrust had rendered the life of her friend so
miserable? No! Oh, no!&quot; And yet the thought, once entertained, would not
be banished. &quot;What if he is? How can I find out? How would he bear it? What
a happy future he might have! What shall I do? What can I say?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Her habitual frankness
came to her aid. She had mechanically given him the paper and sank back in her
chair, while he was so occupied in glancing over the items that he had not
noticed her wild stare of astonishment.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Mr.
Lambert—&quot; She stopped; her heart seemed to rise up in her throat and choke
her. &quot;Mr. Lambert, did you ever live in Madrid? I saw the address on an
open letter. I do not ask from mere curiosity.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;The most
blissful and the most wretched days of my life were passed in that city.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Mr. Lambert,
something has happened to me.  I—I can't think of business to-day. Will you
excuse and trust me as though I were your own daughter? I want to tell you
about a dear friend, the grandmother of the beautiful boy you have heard me
speak about with such rapture. I promised to bring him to see you some day. That
boy is a native of Madrid.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What is the
mother's name?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Cheriton, Mrs.
Juliette Cheriton.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He shook his head
thoughtfully.  &quot;I never heard the name.&quot; He laid down the paper with
a little vexed and disappointed air, adding, &quot;I haven't been in Madrid for
more than eighteen years.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It is Mrs.
Cheriton's mother who is my special friend. She is one of the loveliest, most
accomplished ladies I know, and such an earnest Christian, too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Is her name
Cheriton?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh, no! Eugene's
mother is her daughter. She calls herself Douglass.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Douglass!&quot;
Mr. Lambert started forward, then sank back and looked as though he had been
struck. Presently, with his hand on his heart, he said in a choking voice,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Tell me all you
know. Don't spare me. This suspense is killing me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I will tell you
all, though I can only suspect the truth. Mrs. Douglass, as my friend chooses
to be called, told me this was not her wedded name. Just before her daughter's
birth, painful family circumstances arose, which caused a separation between
herself and her husband. She has never seen him since.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Did she confide
these circumstances to you?&quot; The voice seemed to come from a tomb.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, she did,
and it has been her life-long regret that she could not explain them to the one
most interested.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You are an
innocent child. Mrs. Douglass, as she calls herself, was my wife. She has
deceived you. I saw what I saw with my own eyes. She even gave up the ring I
presented her on our betrothal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Mr. Lambert, you
must be calm. She does not deserve such bitter scorn. You were deceived in one
particular. You thought her an only child. She had a brother, a wild, reckless
man, who afterward paid the penalty for his crimes. Mr. Douglass forbade all
mention of his name, and frequently alluded to his daughter as his only child. It
was this wicked, daring fellow who suddenly appeared to my friend, and almost
drove her wild by demanding money or jewels from her. She agreed to see him
once, and give him all she could raise, on condition he would never cross her
path again. She did see him. He seized her and held her forcibly while he
wrested from her finger the valuable ring you had given her. His cruelty nearly
cost her her life. She was carried to her bed, fell into convulsions, during which
her child was born. The resolve she had made to tell you the truth at whatever
cost, even her father's displeasure, it was impossible for her to carry out.
Before she was well enough to understand what had passed, her husband, deceived
and betrayed by a servant, who with tears and groans confessed her guilt, was a
witness to the meeting between herself and her brother. He believed her lost to
him and to virtue. He himself carried her in his arms to her couch, when,
overcome by her brother's cruelty, she fainted, but he never gave her an
opportunity to explain the painful meeting. If he had—&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She was interrupted by
a terrible groan from Mr. Lambert. He threw his arms up, then, with a gurgling
sound in his throat, he sank back, insensible.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion flew to the
door and screamed for the valet. She loosened the necktie, and began vigorously
to chafe the cold hands, but it was some minutes before he revived.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;The doctor
cautioned him to avoid all excitement,&quot; said the servant, with a
reproachful glance at the visitor. &quot;Ever since those foreign letters came
he's been terribly took down.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion was bending
over him, with her hand on his forehead, when he opened his eyes.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Don't—leave—me,&quot;
he gasped. Presently he spoke again. &quot;Do you think God will forgive
me?&quot; The tone was so piteous she found it impossible to control her voice
to answer.  She bowed her head.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Will you take a
little hartshorn, sir?&quot; asked the valet.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>When it had been
administered, he said, &quot;Stay in the anteroom, Miss Howard may need
you.—Pray for me,&quot; he added the moment they were alone.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, I will; but
first I want to tell you that your wife, if Mrs. Douglass is indeed your wife,
has loved you all these years. She blames herself that she did not insist that
her father should tell you of her brother Henreich. I do not think there has
been a day these last ten years that she has not prayed for your
conversion.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>His lip quivered like
a grieved child, while great tears rolled down his pale cheeks. In a voice
scarcely more than a whisper, he said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Do you think it
possible that she will forgive me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;She has forgiven
you already.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>There was a long
silence after this. Mr. Lambert's countenance showed that a terrible struggle
was going on in his breast. Marion could not look upon it, and covered her
face, her cry going up to God for help and comfort to this poor man. At last,
recalling his request, she fell on her knees, and in a low tone offered up her
petitions in his behalf.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>When she rose to her
feet, she was startled at the awful pallor which had settled on his features.
She put her fingers on his pulse, and to her terror found there was scarcely
any beat.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Go for the
doctor as quickly as possible,&quot; she cried to the servant. &quot;No, send
some one. Don't leave me! He is very low.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Fortunately the
physician was near at hand and was soon at the bedside. In a few words Marion
related the wonderful story, that she had just made the discovery that Mrs.
Douglass was Mr. Lambert's wife, which accounted for his alarming state of
exhaustion.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>For several hours it
was doubtful whether Mr. Lambert would ever speak again. The physician told
Marion that his case was a very  critical one, but at length they were able to
force down a tonic, and soon after he sank into slumber.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The room was darkened,
every sound hushed, and the faithful valet sat alone to watch and wait by his
master's bedside.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It was night when he
awoke; the physician had been in and out several times, and ordered a few
spoonsful of nourishment as soon as he awoke. This was given him and he tried
to speak.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Miss
Howard.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;She is not here.
She said she would be back early in the morning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I may not live
till then. Take—a—pen—and—write. With my dying breath I ask her to forgive
me.—I leave to her—all—that I have—in the—world,—with my dying—love and
blessing.  She, Miss—Howard, will—know who—I mean. Tell her not to let our
daughter think too hard of her father. Fold—it and direct to Miss Howard.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Meanwhile Marion had
returned home in such a state of excitement and fatigue that the physician, who
took her there, sent her at once to bed, and ordered Hepsey to give her a
powerful anodyne. When she woke, Mr. Lambert's servant had been to say that he
wanted to see her as soon as she was able. Hepsey insisted that she should not
go until she had eaten a hearty breakfast.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I think you
ought to consider what Mr. Angus would say,&quot; she urged, &quot;and for his
sake take a little care of your health.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Hepsey, I feared
last night that Mr. Lambert was dead, and, oh, Hepsey, it was what I had been
telling him that made him fall into the swoon! You will not wonder that I was
sick with fear when I tell you about it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I shall tell Mr.
Angus that you've had enough of excitement for one life, and he'd better get
you to the country as soon as he can.&quot;</span></p>

<h1><span class='c6'>RECONCILIATION AND HAPPINESS.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>THE carriage was
already at the door, and Miss Howard drove hastily to Mr. Lambert's residence.
She was informed that he was stronger, had taken more nourishment, and was
again asleep. The valet came from the chamber where the sick man had been
carried and gave her the sealed envelope; and with this in her hand she started
for Mrs. Douglass's boarding-house, scarcely daring to read the words, lest she
should unfit herself for the exciting scenes she must expect. After a cursory
glance at the page she thrust it back into the envelope, and endeavored to form
some plan by which she might best convey to her invalid friend the wonderful
discovery she had made.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Early as it was, Mrs.
Cheriton had taken her boy for a walk. Mrs. Douglass sat reading by the
window.  She greeted Miss Howard with a smile and then, noticing her flushed
face, asked,-</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Are you well,
dear?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Can you bear
good news, Mrs. Douglass?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Good news seldom
hurts any one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Have you ever
thought that your husband might be living near you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I know where he
lives; I learned it by accident while in the country and found it impossible to
remain away.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;And that
explains your sudden return and your watching so constantly from the
windows?&quot; Marion's tone was full of wonder.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I never told you
his name. How did you find it out?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion then related
all that had passed, and ended with giving the paper which the sick man had
dictated when he thought himself dying.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mrs. Douglass's
countenance expressed the deepest feeling, but she braced herself against
giving way to her excitement.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I have been
praying earnestly that I might be prepared for this discovery, should it take
place,&quot; she said. &quot;I will go with you and assure him of my entire
forgiveness. Juliette knows nothing of her father's desertion, and she need not
be made acquainted with the discovery.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Oh, Mrs. Douglass,
I am sure he will never part with you again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She shook her head,
rose, and put on her bonnet and shawl.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion saw that, while
she was making a great effort to appear calm, her hands trembled so much that
she could not tie the bonnet-strings. Unobserved by the lady, she wrote with
pencil on a piece of paper:—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Dear Mrs.
Cheriton,—</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>I have taken your
mother with me. Please remain</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>at home with Geenie
till I call or send for you.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>MARION.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>This she left in plain
sight on the table.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>On their way little
was spoken until they approached the door, when Marion said,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I hope the
doctor will be there. I dare not take you to Mr. Lambert's room without his
permission.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The servant who opened
the door stared at the new-comer, and said to Miss Howard,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Mr. Lambert is
too ill, ma'am, to see visitors.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, I know.
This lady is going with me to the parlor to see the doctor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She gave Mrs. Douglass
her arm, and found from the manner the lady leaned against her that she could
scarcely support herself.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The valet came at
once. &quot;Mr. Lambert is awake,&quot; he said, &quot;and has been calling for
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I cannot leave
this lady alone. Is the doctor here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;He's just going,
miss. I hear him coming downstairs.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Ask him to come
here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Dr. Danforth,
this is my friend, Mr. Lambert's wife. Can she see him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Go and tell him
she is here. He is as impatient this morning as ever old Mr. Regy was.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The doctor tried to
smile, but looked anxious.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I thought you
would never come,&quot; said the sick man in a petulant tone. &quot;I might
have died without ever asking her to forgive me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Would you like
to see her now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Would I?&quot;
He gave a scream which speedily brought the valet to his side.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Get me up! Bring
my clothes! Where is she? Don't let her go! I'll be ready in a minute.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The valet was
thunderstruck, and looked at Miss Howard helplessly.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Mr.
Lambert,&quot; said Marion, in an authoritative tone, &quot;if you don't lie
down and be calm I'll take Mrs. Lambert away again. There, that is right!&quot;
as he assented like a penitent boy.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You must be
calm, for her sake. She is an invalid, and has been for years.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Will you explain
to her why I can't go to her?  It's my place. Are you sure she'll forgive
me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Yes, I'm
sure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Now,&quot; said
Marion, addressing the valet, who stood in open-mouthed wonder, &quot;you may
go to the parlor and ask the doctor to assist Mrs. Lambert up the stairs.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The sick man quickly
covered his face, and she heard him whispering a prayer for help. &quot;For his
sake and for your own, be as calm as possible,&quot; said Dr. Ross, leaving the
lady at the door and motioning the servant to retire.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion only waited to
see the long-deserted wife glide quickly to the bedside, and then she, too,
left them alone. The meeting was too sacred for any eye but the omnipresent One
to witness.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion Howard was
blessed with an excellent constitution, but of late her keen sympathy with her
friends, her frequent visits to her mission scholars, in connection with the
arrangements she was making to leave, in addition to her own numerous cares,
the purchase of her trousseau, etc., had taxed her strength to an unusual
degree. Now that the wife was restored to her husband, Dr. Danforth insisted that
she should go home and take some rest.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I will, as soon
as I have brought Mrs. Cheriton and her boy.&quot; She had scarcely finished
her sentence before a sudden attack of dizziness made her clutch at a chair for
support.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;You must return,
and at once,&quot; he said. &quot;I will do all that is necessary. I prophesy
that this discovery will be the most effectual remedy for Mr. Lambert.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Marion found it most
prudent to yield, and hastily leaving word that Mrs. Cheriton was to be sent
for, she left the doctor to make all needed explanation for her sudden
departure. The next morning, in consequence of a telegram from Dr. Ross, Mrs.
Asbury made her appearance, and coolly remarked that she had come to stay till
her niece was able to return with her.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>On a bright October
morning let us take a peep at Mr. Lambert and his now united family. They have
left the grand house in the city to spend the autumn months on his farm in the
country. To see our friend now we should not imagine him to have been so
recently one of Dr. Danforth's sickest patients.  His heart and his conscience at
rest, his countenance grows daily more serene, while he declares he feels as
young and fresh as he ever did. His wife, Mrs. Douglass no more, moves quietly
about, keeping within sight of the husband from whom she has been so long
separated. She is making a study of his character eccentricities and all, and
has already gained such an influence over him that his eye turns naturally
toward her for approval. Many times in a day he asks for and receives a full assurance
of her entire forgiveness. Many hours are passed in recounting the events which
have occurred since they last met, the keen disappointment he experienced when
at last, unable longer to endure the suspense, he wrote a friend in Madrid for
news of her, and learned that it was supposed she was deceased, and had been for
many years.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The ring once wrested
from her finger by her unnatural brother was restored to its old place, it
having been taken from the prisoner just before his execution. As they looked
at it and called to mind all the wonderful providences which after so many
years had brought them together, their hearts were filled with new gratitude to
their Heavenly Father, who had out of these afflictions led them to a knowledge
of Himself.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Toward his beautiful
daughter, Juliette Cheriton, Mr. Lambert exhibited a ludicrous respect, mingled
with an unbounded admiration. He found it extremely difficult to convince
himself that she in reality was his child.  He watched her stealthily, blushing
like a boy when caught doing so. On the subject of her husband he was at first
reticent. It was, however, the occasion of reviving his old habit of grumbling
when he heard a wish expressed that Mr. Cheriton would return, that there might
be a complete union of the family. He rushed about the room growling,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;He'd better not,
the villain; I'd soon settle him. Let him stay away! I'll let him understand I
don't intend to leave her a penny.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In the mean time he
lavished every indulgence upon her. She had a pony carriage for her exclusive
use. Her purse was kept filled to overflowing. If it had been possible to spoil
her he would have done it.  How often in these days her mother thanked God that
her daughter had not been brought into such temptations to worldliness until
she had learned to place her affections on objects higher and more enduring.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>For his grandson Mr.
Lambert felt such intense pride that he needed constant checks in order that
the boy need not take advantage of the foolish fondness bestowed on him. If Mr.
Lambert had never had a master before, he had one now, and as we enter the
house this bright autumnal morning, a sight meets us which is proof of the
fact.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>A wide hall runs
directly through the old-fashioned dwelling, and racing back and forth through
this hall is our old friend, dressed as his double, Mr. Regy, his long white
hair floating behind him, as he obeys the whip of his young driver, and
canters, trots, or walks in obedience to the orders of his grandson.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Get up, horse;
go faster, grandpa!&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Geenie in his voyage
of discovery has resurrected many old and once familiar objects, and among them
Mr. Regy's dress.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What's this? Who
wears this?&quot; he shouts, holding up the wig and beard to view.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Being obliged to
confess that he has sometimes worn these singular articles, the boy demands
that they be at once used by his horse; and the owner, never dreaming that it
was possible to refuse, donned them, and with a pair of worsted reins round his
body proceeded to jingle the bells, running and cantering, to the perfect
delight of the young driver.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Well for all concerned
it was that Mrs. Cheriton had learned from sad experience that if she wished
her son to love and respect her she must enforce obedience to her own commands
and to the commands of God. Mr. Lambert, though he often pleaded that the
child's wishes, however unreasonable, might be gratified, and was once or twice
detected in comforting him with confectionery under his disappointments, yet
acknowledged that his daughter's discipline was necessary and must be
maintained.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>A most ludicrous scene
had once taken place between Eugene and his grandfather, which those who saw it
never forgot.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The boy had disobeyed,
and his mother placed him in a room by himself to reflect upon his fault, for
which he was to be punished. He was sitting soberly in the chair where she had
placed him, when, hearing a sound from the adjoining room, he went in and found
his grandfather weeping.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What are you
crying for, grandpa?&quot; he asked, quickly.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I don't want
your mother to whip you, but she must; yes, it's right for her to do it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Don't cry,
grandpa; I don't mind. She doesn't hurt me any; she only tickles me a little.
'T isn't nice for a big man like you to cry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Eugene, come
here,&quot; called his mother, taking his hand to lead him back to his chair.
She repeated what she had heard to her mother, saying,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I had as much as
I could do to keep from showing my amusement. Father looking so penitent, and
Eugene comforting him.&quot;</span></p>

<h1><a id="Part_2_Chapter_14"><span class='c8'>CHAPTER XIV.</span></a></h1>

<h1><span class='c6'>CHRISTMAS DAY.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>IT is Christmas day.
The chimes in the spire of the new church are playing sweet melodies; and the
Sunday-school children, whose gift the chimes have been, are gathering together
from all quarters of the town to practise with their teachers the Christmas
carols they are to sing.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>This is the first
service in the beautiful new church. It is to be publicly dedicated to the
worship of God on the next Sabbath, but for weeks the workmen have put forth
all their energies to have it ready for a service on Christmas day. The choir
have been practising, too; and it is rumored new organist is expected, although
his engagement does not commence till the first of January.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The sleigh-bells
jingle merrily, for the ground is covered with snow. Even now, an hour before
service, several stalls in the neat row of horse-sheds are occupied. Now here
comes Farmer Rand, smiling and nodding, and shouting his Christmas salutations
to young and old, as he drives his old horse up the ascent, through the gate
close to the nicely shovelled flagged walk to the front. The good farmer has a precious
load to-day, and he is very careful of it. Yes, that is Lucy, his old woman, so
wrapped up in shawls and buffalo-robes—with a hot brick in her great yellow
muff, and another at her feet, which just now are cased in a pair of her
husband's blue socks—that she finds it almost impossible to alight from the
sleigh.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>For weeks the good
woman has been nursing her strength for this great and joyful occasion. For
days she and her man have watched the signs of the weather, have even prayed
that, if it was God's will, it might be so propitious as to make it safe for
her to go up to the house of the Lord and join with His people in their anthems
of praise to the new-born King.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Fortunately the sexton
has recognized the farmer, and runs quickly to offer his services it helping
her to the porch. One and another come forward to greet her and express their
pleasure at seeing her here. The children, even, gather round her pew and say,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Merry Christmas,
Miss Rand! How do you like the new church?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Yes, on this natal day
of the world's Redeemer every face looks joyful, every voice responds heartily
to the kind wishes of his neighbor. It is evident that a great wave of love and
good-will is flowing through all their hearts as they suddenly pause and listen
to the children's joyous tones chanting the strains the angels sang, &quot;Glory
to God in the highest. Peace on earth, good-will to men.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The service is to
commence at eleven. The hand on the new and elegant clock, a gift from the
Pastor, points to five minutes before eleven; the children have finished their
practising and gone quietly to their seats at one end of the organ loft. The
slips are all full. There is a hush. There comes the pastor and his bride, not
a stranger, but known and loved by all. Pausing for an instant to show her into
the pew, the first one selected in the house, he passes on up the aisle into
the study at the side of the pulpit. Ethel, the only other occupant of the
slip, causes a smile by her obsequious attentions to the bride. She takes a
hymn-book from the rack, and, though unable to read a word, opens it and passes
it, gets as near Marion as possible, and finally, with a burst of affection,
seizes her hand.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And Marion, her beaming
face radiant with happiness, stands up with the congregation, while the choir
sing the famous old fugue,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;While shepherds
watched their flocks by night,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>All seated on the
ground,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The angel of the Lord
came down,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And glory shone
around.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Recalling all the
goodness of the Lord to her during the last year, the answers to her prayers,
the many friends, who, one year ago, were without Christ, now with Him, the
happiness to which she may look forward with the chosen companion of her life,
her heart swells with gratitude to the good Father who has directed her path in
such mercy, and to the dear Saviour whose advent they are so joyously
celebrating. She thanks God, and takes courage to go on laboring to bring those
about her to a saving knowledge of His love.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Her husband, glancing
at her from the pulpit, sees that her eyes are filled with tears, and he, too,
thanks God, as he says to himself, &quot;They are happy tears.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>As long as we are the
inhabitants of this earth, we must expect occasional clouds with our sunshine.
Disappointments are the lot of mankind, and certainly neither Mr. Angus nor
Miss Howard expected to be exempt from them. The plan from the first had been
to have the wedding the week before Christmas, and a reception or housewarming
at Ingleside the following Monday. But, from one cause and another, the new
house was not finished, and this plan had to be postponed.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It was Marion's
preference to defer the wedding till such time as the house was considered fit
for occupation. Such a pressure was, however, brought to bear on her, that she
yielded to the wishes of her friend. He brought so many arguments to prove that
the plan he now proposed was even better than the original one, that the few
weeks before entering on the duties of housekeeping would give her just the
leisure necessary for the formation of some of their new plans, etc., that,
with a hearty laugh, she replied,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I see that you
intend to have your way, and as I believe that God intended the husband to be
the head of the family, I suppose I may as well begin my obedience now. So on
the week before Christmas the wedding shall be.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>I am very sure if my
reader had not seen Mr. Angus since I first introduced him he would not
recognize him now. Then he was bowed down with grief, not only for himself, but
for one whom he had every reason to suppose was cherishing as toward her
brother such anger in her heart as would cut her off from Divine forgiveness. He
was, or felt himself to be, alone in the world. He had no right to form a tie
which would make another the sharer of such a burden as his. To be sure, he had
brooded over that one scene in his past life until he had become morbid, and
perhaps had not relief come to him he might have become unfit to preach the
gospel of glad tidings to his fellow-men. When he walked, his eyes were cast
down to the ground, while sighs were much more frequent with him than smiles.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Now how different. He
walked erect, with elastic tread, his eyes met yours with a frank smile.  One
could scarcely be with him five minutes without being drawn to him by a certain
magnetism. You felt that his heart was at rest, and more, you could not fail to
be sure that he was grateful for God's goodness, that he was literally obeying
the Divine injunction, &quot;Rejoice in the Lord alway, and again, I say,
rejoice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. and Mrs. Asbury
cordially extended an invitation to the young couple to remain with them till
spring. The gentleman even urged the necessity of having his niece close at
hand until certain building plans, etc., were complete. But this needs
explanation.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'> </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>It was not probable
that such grateful friends as Mr. and Mrs. Lambert would allow so grand an
occasion as Miss Howard's marriage to take place without some act expressive of
their deep affection and respect. Now that Mr. Lambert had a wife and daughter
with whom he could consult, he spent much time in the discussion of what would
be the most acceptable wedding present. Once, hearing the word &quot;jewelry&quot;
from his daughter, he shouted,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Jewelry! Would
she like diamonds? I'll buy up a case of them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I said I was
sure she would not care for jewelry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;What shall it
be, then? Not that anything we can do will ever prove to her our sense of her
goodness and faithfulness to us; but it must be something to show her that I
value my family, owe to her my finding them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>One day, before she
left the city, Marion accepted an urgent invitation to pass a day at the
country home of her friends. She also was requested to bring Esther and Neddy
Carter with her. During the day, the young lady, wholly unsuspicious of the
object of the visit, frankly narrated her own and Mr. Angus's plans for the
good of the town. Among other things, she said that there was no library for
free circulation, adding, &quot;One of my most-cherished plans is to build a
neat and attractive house,</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>with two large rooms,
one for a library of well-selected books, the other a reading-room for both
secular and religious papers, and also some of the best magazines. But we can't
do everything in one year.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mrs. Lambert had
suggested to her impulsive husband that it would be more delicate not to allude
to the subject of a wedding gift, but here, he thought, is just the way to
please her. He rushed from the room, motioning his wife to follow, and after
sundry antics, such as would have better befitted Geenie's years, he drew a
blank check, and with his fingers on his lips, held it up before his astonished
companion.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It's for the library,&quot;
he said, putting his lips close to her ear.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She nodded approval
with a cordial smile, but pointed to the blank space.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Let her fill it
up. Will ten thousand do? It must be nothing mean.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Suppose we wait
a little and try to ascertain the probable cost.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;No, I can't
wait! I want it off my mind. If you don't want to see old Mr. Regy,&quot; with
a comical grin, &quot;you'll help me now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She put her hand
lovingly on his shoulder, which never failed to calm his impatience, and asked
softly, &quot;Why not, then, let her fill it up, as you suggested?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;So I
will!&quot;  He held the check toward her and motioned her to give it.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;No, my dear,
generous husband, that pleasure belongs to you; I can see just how her eyes
will sparkle and those pretty dimples begin to play.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He flatly refused.
&quot;No,&quot; he said, laughing, &quot;if I were to attempt it I should be
old Regy again in a minute.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She sat down at his
desk and wrote,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Dear Friend,—</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>We have tried in
vain to think of a gift for your</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>approaching
marriage which will in any measure suitably express</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>to you our
appreciation of your invaluable friendship.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>Your remark just
now in regard to a library and reading-room</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>has suggested the
idea of giving to you funds sufficient for that</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>worthy object and
letting you use them as you think proper.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>JULIETTE D.
LAMBERT.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><i><span class='c6'>M. R. LAMBERT.</span></i></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She gave it to her
husband to read and sign, enclosed the blank check, and carried it into the
next room and gave it to Miss Howard.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>With what astonishment
and delight the young lady read it, the embraces and thanks which followed, I
must leave my reader to imagine. In the midst of the excitement which followed,
Mr. Lambert, who had chosen to remain behind, raced from one end of the room to
the other, where he was found by Eugene holding on to his sides and making the
most strenuous endeavors to restrain his laughter.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>In consequence of this
generous gift, a lot of land was purchased, not far from the public school, and
the town at a public meeting, called for the purpose, added to the library lot
a large field formerly used for pasturage. This was to be fitted up for all
sorts of games and athletic sports.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Mr. Lambert and his
family went to Grantbury, and insisted that the library building be two
stories, the upper story to be finished off into a hall for concerts, school
exhibitions, etc. The eccentric old gentleman was very angry when it was
proposed to name this &quot;Lambert Hall,&quot; in token of gratitude to the
giver.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;I've nothing to
do with it,&quot; he insisted. &quot;Put it Howard Hall or Angus Hall, if you
please.  It's nothing to me, any way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Except that your
name stands at the bottom of the check for the cost,&quot; replied Marion, with
an arch glance in his face.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Things have come
to a pretty pass—wedding present—chose that rather than diamonds.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He was growling away
in the genuine old style, when Geenie made them all laugh heartily by calling
out,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Grandma, did you
bring Mr. Regy's wig? He has come back again.&quot;</span></p>

<h1><a id="Part_2_Chapter_15"><span class='c8'>CHAPTER XV.</span></a></h1>

<h1><span class='c6'>OUR INGLESIDE.</span></h1>

<p class="PreformattedText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>ESTHER COLE had
received two letters, or rather notes, from her husband since the one she wrote
him; but now months had passed without a word in answer to her regular weekly
letter. Mr. Angus was greatly interested in the young wife who was so patiently
enduring her trials, and insisted that she ought to be allowed to follow the
dictates of her own conscience in regard to her connection with her husband.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Day after day Esther
looked for a letter, but looked in vain. At length, pitying her too evident
disappointment, Mr. Angus wrote to the chaplain of the prison, making inquiries
in regard to the man. The letter, about which he had said nothing, was answered
immediately, and contained a slip cut from an Auburn paper. Joseph Cole, with
three of the worst prisoners, had escaped from their confinement early one dark
night. They had nearly killed a watchman who ran to give notice, and had so far
escaped justice.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The chaplain added
that the criminals had been subsequently traced to New Orleans, where a gang of
roughs had been seized for arson and murder.  On the trial it was proved that
the younger and apparently the most hardened had a number of aliases, but that
his real name was Joseph Cole.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;My poor,
trusting Esther!&quot; exclaimed Marion to her husband, &quot;this will end
your faith in your husband's reformation. This will settle the question of your
return to him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>But greatly to her
surprise, and to the surprise of all Esther's friends, though she mourned so
deeply over Joseph's sins that her cheeks grew colorless and her eyes looked
into yours more wistfully than ever, she yet held fast to her belief that God
had power to touch the hardest heart, and that in answer to her importunate prayers
He would, in His own good time, lead him to penitence and a godly life.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;Whether he ever
comes back to me or not is of little consequence, ma'am,&quot; she said, as
Marion was trying to comfort her. &quot;I don't think I shall live many years,
but, oh, I do long for him to know how God can comfort people! What would I do
now, ma'am, if I were without Christ, as I once was? If poor Joe only had
Christ, he would be happier than he ever was in his life, even though he is in
his cell.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The last was said with
a piteous sob, which went to the listener's heart far more than the loudest
wails.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And here we must leave
our humble friend. We know that God did fill her heart with such thoughts of
Himself, of His pitying tenderness toward all His creatures, that she was
comforted under the bitterest sorrow a Christian can be called to endure,—the
unworthiness of those we love.  We leave her to the gracious sympathizing
Saviour.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Glancing forward a few
years, I am sure the reader will be pleased to learn that Neddy Carter is
fulfilling the promise of his childhood. Meeting him in the street, one would
never imagine that he is indebted to artificial supports for his ability to go
from place to place, while his clear, brown eyes, looking you so straight in
the face, his open brow, and abundant, wavy locks, interest the most casual
observer.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>If he were asked,
&quot;Who is the happiest youth in this great city?&quot; he would, without
hesitation, answer,—</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&quot;It would be hard
to find a happier boy than I am since my mother goes with me regularly to
church.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>He is and will be for
years to come a protégé of Mr. Lambert, who has given over a sum of money to
proper guardians for the purpose of educating him.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>The library building
is finished, the shelves are lined with books selected by the pastor, who is
the chairman of the library association, and a company of ladies and gentlemen
appointed for the purpose. The hall above, forty feet by sixty, is fitted up
with a curtain, foot-lights, etc., but can never be used except with the consent
of Mrs. Marion Howard Angus. After many discussions, the name &quot;Howard
Hall&quot; is conspicuous over the desk, but our old friend Marion is eager to
assure every one who points to it that it is a memorial, not to herself, but to
her father.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>A very pleasant
circumstance in connection with the library is that Mary Falkner, now confirmed
in health and activity, was unanimously chosen librarian, with a salary large
enough to support herself and her mother.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>One more scene, and I
have done.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Accompany me, dear
reader, up this smoothly gravelled walk to the elegant mansion at the summit of
Church Hill. Notice as you pass that luxurious vine winding itself so lovingly
around the pillars. The slip from which it has grown was brought by Mr. Angus
from the old Ingleside homestead.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Although it is June,
the mornings are cool, and as we push open a French window and step in from the
wide, uncovered piazza, we see an open fireplace, with a few embers smouldering
away on the high brass and irons. There is an air of refinement and cosey,
homelike comfort about the room that we would like to describe, but something of
still greater interest attracts us.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Sitting on a low chair
near the fire is a young girl, whom we soon recognize as the little Ethel we
loved so dearly. As we have seen her so many times, she is still hovering over
a cradle, but this time the occupant is a living, breathing, cooing, jumping,
heart-winning baby.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>At this moment the
little one is sleeping. Ethel gazes lovingly at the fair countenance, the rosy
lips moving in pleasant recollection of the sweets it has tasted, the long,
curly lashes resting on the plump cheek, and acknowledges to herself that live
babies are a great improvement on dolls.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>Now voices are heard
in the hall. Just as a lady and gentleman enter, a carryall drives to the door.
The gentleman has on his arm sundry wraps, an afghan, a tiny cap being daintily
held on his outstretched fingers. There is a new expression on his features,
and we can scarcely believe that this tall athlete, this noble-looking man, with
a smile on his lips, which looks as though it belonged there, is the same
gentleman whom we first knew as Harold Angus.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>But how shall I
describe our Marion? The eyes are as bright, the dimples still in view, but the
whole face is flooded with a new light. It is the mother love.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>She takes little
Stella from the cradle, uttering those soothing sounds which even the youngest
babies so well understand, and dresses her for the ride, Ethel, meanwhile,
looking on in wondering admiration.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>They are going to the
station to meet their dear friends, Dr. and Mrs. B-, from the Home for the
Sick, and when they have driven around the town, intend to bring them home for
a quiet Sunday.</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span class='c6'>And this is our Ingleside.</span></p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
